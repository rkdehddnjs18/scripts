<div>Narr:   Still hesitant, you make your way towards the house.</div>
<div>Me:     (So many memories here...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Bad ones... But I can't lie... Some good ones too.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Do I knock? Or just go in?)</div>
<div>Me:     (Maybe it would be better if...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Suddenly, the door bursts open.</div>
<div>Emily:  [m!t]!</div>
<div>Me:     Hi...</div>
<div>Narr:   She jumps you, almost making you lose your balance.</div>
<div>Emily:  Oh, how I missed you!</div>
<div>Me:     Missed you too, Em...</div>
<div>Emily:  Awww!</div>
<div>Narr:   A few seconds pass while neither of you says anything.</div>
<div>Me:     Would you mind climbing down now?</div>
<div>Emily:  Nope, not yet!</div>
<div>Narr:   You did have your reason for asking...</div>
<div>Narr:   Emily's breasts were pressed hard against your chest.</div>
<div>Me:     You've really grown.</div>
<div>Emily:  I did?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, and you're heavy.</div>
<div>Narr:   Hearing this, she gets off.</div>
<div>Emily:  Hey! That's no way to talk to a lady.</div>
<div>Me:     Oh? So now you're a lady?</div>
<div>Emily:  Yeah... Not really...</div>
<div>Emily:  Never mind. Come in!</div>
<div>Narr:   For a split second, you hesitate...</div>
<div>Narr:   But Emily grabs your hand.</div>
<div>Narr:   And pulls you inside.</div>
<div>Emily:  Aaaand...</div>
<div>Me:     And?</div>
<div>Emily:  How's college?</div>
<div>Me:     Oh. Good, I guess...</div>
<div>Emily:  Must be better than good, since you haven't shown your face around here in a while.</div>
<div>Me:     You see, I...</div>
<div>Kiara:  Look what the cat dragged in.</div>
<div>Me:     Hi, Kiara.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Hey.</div>
<div>tut This game features something called "x-ray".</div>
<div>tut Use your cursor to highlight and press the left mouse button in the upper left corner.</div>
<div>tut This will enter an "x-ray mode". You can leave it by pressing anywhere on the screen.</div>
<div>tut Try it yourself.</div>
<div>Me:     Didn't know you're back at camp.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Didn't think I would be.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Anyway, nice to see you, [m!t].</div>
<div>Me:     You too.</div>
<div>Kiara:  We'll talk later. Gotta go prepare the cabins.</div>
<div>Me:     Sure.</div>
<div>Me:     (Not even a hug... Well, that's kind of to be expected, since...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Something else grabs your attention.</div>
<div>Emily:  Anyone at college catch your eye?</div>
<div>Me:     Huh?</div>
<div>Emily:  College? Hot girls?</div>
<div>Me:     Hahaha, sure... There are some hot ones out there.</div>
<div>Me:     But, I'm kinda seeing someone.</div>
<div>Emily:  You are?! Who?!</div>
<div>Emily:  What's her name?!</div>
<div>Emily:  How old is she?!</div>
<div>Emily:  Are you taking classes together?!</div>
<div>Emily:  Is she hot?</div>
<div>Emily:  Do you have a picture of her?!</div>
<div>Emily:  What am I even talking about? Of course you do!</div>
<div>Emily:  Why haven’t you already shown me?!</div>
<div>Me:     Could I unpack first?</div>
<div>Emily:  Right... Silly me.</div>
<div>Emily:  Sorry, I just get so excited!</div>
<div>Me:     Some things never change, I guess. (Still, she did grow up so much.)</div>
<div>Emily:  Guess not. *Giggle*</div>
<div>Emily:  Oh right, that reminds me!</div>
<div>Emily:  Eve said you should unpack once you arrive and she'll come and find you.</div>
<div>Emily:  Here's the key to your room.</div>
<div>Emily:  You better get going. So we still have time to hang out afterwards.</div>
<div>Me:     Sounds good to me!</div>
<div>tut This game features navigation.</div>
<div>tut Use your cursor to highlight interactable objects like doors, items or characters.</div>
<div>tut To interact with them, simply press the left mouse button.</div>
<div>tut The game also has a HINT system. If you get stuck, click on question mark in the upper right corner to see what you need to do next.</div>
<div>tut To use the map during free roam mode, click on the compass icon below the other icons in the sidebar on the right side of the screen.</div>
<div>tut Upon clicking the compass icon, the map of your current location will appear on the screen.</div>
<div>Me:     Where did I put the key?</div>
<div>            Me:     Oh! Here it is!</div>
<div>            Me:     Hmm, I can’t find it. Maybe if I–</div>
<div>            Me:     Oh, it’s unlocked!</div>
<div>Narr:   As you open the door...</div>
<div>Narr:   An overwhelming sense of nostalgia washes over you.</div>
<div>Me:     Heh...(It's still the same.)</div>
<div>Me:     (So many memories...)</div>
<div>Me:     (It almost feels good being back.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Almost...)</div>
<div>Me:     Jane?</div>
<div>Narr:   You open the message. Only to find a hot, nude selfie from Jane.</div>
<div>Jane:   *Still in bed. Wish you were here.*</div>
<div>Me:     *Damn! Girl! You need to warn me before sending something like this.</div>
<div>Jane:   *I do?*</div>
<div>Me:     *Yes.*</div>
<div>Jane:   *Okay. Warning!*</div>
<div>Narr:   As any man would, you start the video...</div>
<div>Narr:   Immediately, you feel your pants tighten.</div>
<div>Narr:   Though, as luck would have it...</div>
<div>Narr:   The door suddenly opens.</div>
<div>Eve:    I heard you were back home!</div>
<div>Eve:    But I had to see for myself.</div>
<div>Narr:   As fast as you can, you put down the phone.</div>
<div>Me:     Hi, Eve.(Shit!)</div>
<div>Eve:    Stand up, silly! Give me a hug!</div>
<div>Narr:   You stand up to give her a hug</div>
<div>Narr:   She comes in to hug you, but you try your best she doesn’t feel your crotch.</div>
<div>Eve:    It's good to see you, [m!t].</div>
<div>Eve:    So good to see you.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, good to see you too, Eve.</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh, how you've grown.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah... You too, Eve.</div>
<div>Eve:    Ha-ha. Still funny as always.</div>
<div>Me:     *Chuckle* You know me.</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh, how I missed you!</div>
<div>Narr:   Without giving you a chance to react, she hugs you... Hard.</div>
<div>Narr:   As she presses against you, she feels your bulge.</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh! I see you've grown in other places too?</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckle* Happy to see me?</div>
<div>Narr:   Instantly, you pull away.</div>
<div>Me:     Eve!</div>
<div>Eve:    What? I'm just joking.</div>
<div>Me:     I know, but still...(She's always been like this.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Not sure why she gets such a kick out of messing with me like this...)</div>
<div>Eve:    Hahaha! You were always so cute when embarrassed.</div>
<div>Eve:    Although, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah... Yeah... I know the talk. "It's normal at my age"... Blah, blah, blah...</div>
<div>Eve:    I wasn't talking about that... I was talking about the size.</div>
<div>Me:     Eve! (She seriously doesn't know how to let it go.)</div>
<div>Eve:    Hahahah! Just joking! Calm down.</div>
<div>Eve:    Jeez! Since when did you get so "stiff"?</div>
<div>Me:     Will you stop it?!</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckle* Okay, okay. I'll stop.</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* Thank you.</div>
<div>Eve:    No, thank you for letting me feel it.</div>
<div>Me:     HEY! You said you'll stop. (Not sure why I even believed her...)</div>
<div>Eve:    That was the last one. I promise.</div>
<div>Me:     Good.</div>
<div>Eve:    This is the best thing to do in awkward situations like this.</div>
<div>Narr:   Knowing what follows, you sit on the bed...</div>
<div>Eve:    If we didn't make a joke out of it, you would've been thinking whether I felt it or not.</div>
<div>Eve:    And I would've been thinking, "Why does [m!t] have an erection?"</div>
<div>Eve:    That means we'd both be thinking about your... Ahmm... And that's a lot more awkward.</div>
<div>Eve:    It would leave a scar on your young, impressionable brain.</div>
<div>Eve:    Not a big one, but... For the next couple of days, you would be thinking, "Did Eve feel my erection?"</div>
<div>Eve:    It would go through your head every time you saw me. You'd be confused, even worried, about it.</div>
<div>Eve:    This way...</div>
<div>Me:     Eve, stop it.</div>
<div>Me:     I get it!</div>
<div>Me:     You don't need to over-analyze me, or this situation.</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh, right! Sorry! Work habit...</div>
<div>Me:     I know.</div>
<div>Eve:    Thank you for coming on such short notice.</div>
<div>Me:     It's okay.</div>
<div>Eve:    I know I probably ruined your summer...</div>
<div>Eve:    But, I really needed you here.</div>
<div>Me:     So, what's going on?</div>
<div>Eve:    As I mentioned on the phone, things are going to be different this year.</div>
<div>Me:     What "things"?</div>
<div>Eve:    The patients.</div>
<div>Me:     What, you're no longer taking in fappers and bullies?</div>
<div>Eve:    No, we graduated to serial killers.</div>
<div>Me:     WHAT?!</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckles* I'm joking, [m!t].</div>
<div>Me:     That wasn't really funny.</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckle* Best I let you unpack.</div>
<div>Eve:    We can talk more during dinner.</div>
<div>Me:     Sure.</div>
<div>Eve:    Okay. I need to get back to work, anyway.</div>
<div>Eve:    See you later.</div>
<div>Me:     Later, Eve.</div>
<div>Narr:   As she leaves, you turn towards your luggage...</div>
<div>tut Panties are a form of collectable item scattered across the camp in various locations. Some are easier to spot...</div>
<div>tut while others will be hidden away in hard to see places.</div>
<div>tut Collecting panties will unlock special images in the gallery, so keep your eyes open for them in each scene!</div>
<div>Me:     (I should finally unpack.)</div>
<div>Me:     (And I gotta make sure not to forget about Jane's text...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Around 20 minutes later...</div>
<div>Me:     (All done. Now to help Kiara finish setting up.)</div>
<div>hint Go to the camp area.</div>
<div>Me:     Need help?</div>
<div>Kiara:  I'm doing the last cabin.</div>
<div>Me:     So, yes or no?</div>
<div>Kiara:  Sure, why not.</div>
<div>Me:     Say...</div>
<div>Kiara:  Huh?</div>
<div>Me:     Eve mentioned something...</div>
<div>Kiara:  What?</div>
<div>Me:     That she's taking in different patients this time around?</div>
<div>Me:     You know anything about that?</div>
<div>Kiara:  Hmmm, she didn't tell me anything.</div>
<div>Me:     Nothing?</div>
<div>Kiara:  Nope. She's probably screwing with you.</div>
<div>Kiara:  It's always the same guys since my first year here.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Delinquent boys and wannabe bad-asses.</div>
<div>Me:     So... Your type, right?</div>
<div>Kiara:  *Chuckle* Maybe...</div>
<div>Me:     You always loved it when they arrived.</div>
<div>Me:     Me, on the other hand...</div>
<div>Kiara:  So what if they didn't like you?</div>
<div>Kiara:  Can you blame them?</div>
<div>Kiara:  They were jealous.</div>
<div>Me:     So that's why they screwed with me?</div>
<div>Kiara:  Umm, I guess...</div>
<div>Kiara:  It wasn't so bad...</div>
<div>Me:     Maybe for you! The "hot girl" in camp no one could touch.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Hmm, that is true, but...</div>
<div>Me:     They're the reason I hate this place from the bottom of my soul.</div>
<div>Kiara:  No, you don't...</div>
<div>Me:     Wanna bet?</div>
<div>Kiara:  How about you just help me clean this cabin?</div>
<div>Me:     Yay... Making beds for animals. Wooo-hoo...</div>
<div>    Narr:   Still unhappy, you decide to help her...</div>
<div>    Narr:   Still unhappy, you help her, and about twenty minutes later...</div>
<div>Kiara:  Pheew! That should be it!</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah...</div>
<div>Narr:   With the cabin prepared, you two walk out.</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* Fuck this...</div>
<div>Kiara:  You aren't a kid anymore.</div>
<div>Kiara:  You can hold your ground now.</div>
<div>Me:     You don't need to tell me that.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Then why are you bitching about it all the time?</div>
<div>Me:     Damn. Ice-cold...</div>
<div>Kiara:  You really don't wanna be here, huh?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, I really don't.</div>
<div>Kiara:  This year won't be so bad.</div>
<div>Kiara:  I have a feeling the guys will be nice.</div>
<div>Me:     I bet you do. (Nice and hot, maybe...)</div>
<div>Kiara:  You trying to say something?</div>
<div>Me:     Nope.</div>
<div>Kiara:  You sure about that?</div>
<div>Me:     Positive.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Oh, shit...</div>
<div>Me:     What is it?</div>
<div>Kiara:  I forgot The Guidelines in the house.</div>
<div>Me:     I'll go get them.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Don't forget, you need to put two in each cabin.</div>
<div>Me:     I remember, Kiara.</div>
<div>Kiara:  *Chuckle* Sorry for doubting you.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Anyway, I think I left them on the kitchen table.</div>
<div>Me:     Got it.</div>
<div>hint Get the guidelines from the kitchen table.</div>
<div>Me:     Here they are.</div>
<div>Emily:  Hey, [m!t]!</div>
<div>Me:     Huh?</div>
<div>Emily:  Wanna go for a swim?</div>
<div>Me:     Oh, umm... I have to--</div>
<div>Emily:  Come on! It's such a nice day!</div>
<div>Me:     I have to get these--</div>
<div>Emily:  Oh, come on...</div>
<div>Emily:  Pretty please? I wanna try on my new bikini!</div>
<div>Me:     I can't right--</div>
<div>Emily:  Trust me, you need a swim after such a long trip. *Giggle*</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* Fine, let's go for a swim. (The lake did look refreshing.)</div>
<div>Emily:  Yaaay!</div>
<div>Me:     But, just a quick dip.</div>
<div>Emily:  Sure.</div>
<div>Me:     Let me go get my trunks.</div>
<div>Emily:  Hurry up.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, yeah.</div>
<div>Narr:   Going upstairs, you rummage through your stuff and pull out your trunks.</div>
<div>Narr:   Putting them on, you rush back downstairs...</div>
<div>Emily:  Ready?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, let's go.</div>
<div>Emily:  Weee!</div>
<div>Narr:   Together, you make your way towards the lake.</div>
<div>Emily:  Hey! Kiara's here too!</div>
<div>Me:     (Is she now?)</div>
<div>Emily:  Kiara! Put on some clothes!</div>
<div>Me:     (Topless?!)</div>
<div>Emily:  Show off!</div>
<div>Emily:  Come on, [m!t], let's go.</div>
<div>Narr:   You and Emily make your way towards the small dock.</div>
<div>Kiara:  What are you two doing here?</div>
<div>Emily:  Going for a swim.</div>
<div>Emily:  What are you doing topless?</div>
<div>Kiara:  Getting a tan.</div>
<div>Me:     Makes sense.</div>
<div>Emily:  Maybe you should be a bit more careful?</div>
<div>Kiara:  What do you care, you little brat.</div>
<div>Emily:  UGH!!! I told you not to call me that!</div>
<div>Emily:  I'm not a kid anymore! I'm nineteen!</div>
<div>Kiara:  Not being a kid doesn't mean you're not still a brat.</div>
<div>Emily:  UGHH!!!</div>
<div>Me:     How about we all calm down a little, huh?</div>
<div>Kiara:  I am calm.</div>
<div>Narr:   Saying this, Kiara lies back down on her stomach.</div>
<div>Emily:  Hmph!</div>
<div>Narr:   Not feeling the need to intervene anymore, you start running...</div>
<div>Narr:   And jump into the lake.</div>
<div>Me:     Ahhh... So refreshing!</div>
<div>Me:     Come on, Emily!</div>
<div>Emily:  Here I come!</div>
<div>Narr:   She starts running...</div>
<div>Narr:   Jumps...</div>
<div>Narr:   And makes the biggest splash she can.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Ahhh!</div>
<div>Emily:  Oooh! It's cold! Why didn't you warn me?!</div>
<div>Kiara:  What the fuck, Emily?!</div>
<div>Narr:   In her fit of rage, Kiara forgets she's topless.</div>
<div>Me:     *Gulp*</div>
<div>Emily:  Sorry!</div>
<div>Kiara:  Oh?! (Shit! I'm topless!)</div>
<div>Narr:   Immediately, she lies back down.</div>
<div>Emily:  Won't happen again!</div>
<div>Kiara:  Yeah, yeah, whatever... (I should be more careful.)</div>
<div>Me:     *Whispers* You did that on purpose, didn't you?</div>
<div>Emily:  *Whispers* Maybe. *Giggle*</div>
<div>Emily:  Brrr! This is too cold for me, I'm getting out.</div>
<div>Me:     What are you talking about? It's perfect.</div>
<div>Emily:  Yeah, maybe for you.</div>
<div>Me:     Booo, party pooper...</div>
<div>Narr:   Ignoring you, Emily swims towards the shore...</div>
<div>Narr:   And gets out of the water as soon as she can.</div>
<div>Narr:   Unbeknownst to her, the new bikini she bought becomes a bit see-through when wet.</div>
<div>Emily:  Brrrr...</div>
<div>Narr:   Her nipples, also, got hard from the icy water.</div>
<div>Narr:   Combined with a slightly transparent bikini...</div>
<div>Narr:   It's a view you're not very comfortable seeing.</div>
<div>Emily:  How can you stay in there?</div>
<div>Me:     It's not so bad. (Oh, fuck... Am I getting hard?)</div>
<div>Me:     I'm going for a swim. (Gotta get this picture out of my head.)</div>
<div>Emily:  You're crazy!</div>
<div>Me:     Probably...</div>
<div>Narr:   Trying to "cool off", you start swimming.</div>
<div>Me:     (What's wrong with me?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (I got hard by looking Emily's tits?)</div>
<div>Me:     (And I'm still hard?! What the...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I mean, it's a normal, physical reaction, right? Right?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (Just my male brain. It sees boobs and the brain sends a signal...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Apparently, it doesn't matter whose.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I mean, what do you expect?)</div>
<div>Me:     (First I see Kiara topless...)</div>
<div>Me:     (And then Emily with that see-through bikini...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Fuck, [m!t]! Get it out of your head!)</div>
<div>Narr:   (Still not calm enough, you decide to swim a bit longer.)</div>
<div>Narr:   And a few minutes later...</div>
<div>Narr:   Finally, you swim up to the dock.</div>
<div>Emily:  *Giggle* Your balls freeze off yet?</div>
<div>Me:     Nah. You coming back in?</div>
<div>Emily:  Not a chance.</div>
<div>Me:     Weren't you the one who wanted to go swimming?</div>
<div>Emily:  Umm... No, I don't recall saying that. *Giggle*</div>
<div>Me:     Kiara? What about you?</div>
<div>Kiara:  I'm good.</div>
<div>Me:     Oh, come on. The water's great, don't listen to Emily.</div>
<div>Kiara:  The weather channel said the next five days will be extremely hot...</div>
<div>Kiara:  Maybe in a day or two, when the water gets a bit warmer.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Besides, I don't even have my swimsuit here.</div>
<div>Me:     Fine, fine...</div>
<div>Emily:  Say... [m!t]?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah?</div>
<div>Emily:  You still haven't told me anything about this girl you're seeing.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Oh? So you are seeing someone?</div>
<div>Emily:  What's her name?</div>
<div>Me:     Jane.</div>
<div>Emily:  Is she hot?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah...</div>
<div>Emily:  Hotter than me?</div>
<div>Me:     Yes.</div>
<div>Emily:  You suuure?</div>
<div>Narr:   You break eye contact as your eyes instinctively move downwards.</div>
<div>Narr:   Unable to speak due to the sight you're witnessing...</div>
<div>Narr:   You simply dive underwater.</div>
<div>Me:     (Did she... Do that on purpose?)</div>
<div>Me:     (Is she not aware that her bikini is see-through?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (Probably not... Yeah, there's no way she did that on purpose.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Shit, I got hard again... Fuck my brain.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Ughh... I need air!)</div>
<div>Narr:   Gasping for air, you pop out of the water.</div>
<div>Emily:  *Pout* You didn't even think about it for a second. Just immediately said yes.</div>
<div>Me:     Umm....</div>
<div>Kiara:  Emily.</div>
<div>Emily:  What?!</div>
<div>Me:     *Gulp*</div>
<div>Kiara:  You do know that bikini of yours is see-through when it gets wet?</div>
<div>Narr:   Confused, Emily looks down...</div>
<div>Emily:  So? Who cares?</div>
<div>Emily:  I'm not "hot", anyway.</div>
<div>Narr:   Looking pretty pissed, she storms off.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Like I said... Brat.</div>
<div>Kiara:  By the way, you should get out of there before you catch a cold.</div>
<div>Me:     I'll just stay in here a little longer, don't worry.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Oh? Yeah, sure. (Hmm, I have a hunch about what's going on...)</div>
<div>Me:     Like I said, it's not that cold.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Whatever you say. (I think we both know why you can't get out.)</div>
<div>Kiara:  I'll leave you to it then...</div>
<div>Kiara:  I'm going inside. Don't wanna get a sunburn.</div>
<div>Me:     Oh, okay.</div>
<div>Narr:   Making sure to cover her boobs, Kiara starts getting up.</div>
<div>Narr:   Carefully, she turns around...</div>
<div>Narr:   Puts on her shirt...</div>
<div>Narr:   And walks away.</div>
<div>Narr:   As she leaves, you get to the pier.</div>
<div>Me:     (I better wait a minute or two, until it goes down again... Just to be safe.)</div>
<div>Narr:   And, a minute or two later, you get out of the lake.</div>
<div>Narr:   Taking the towel Kiara left, you dry yourself off.</div>
<div>Me:     (It felt a little weird wiping myself down with a towel she had under her--)</div>
<div>Me:     (No, no more thinking about shit like that.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Anyway, why did Emily just run away?)</div>
<div>Me:     Hmm... (Is she that insecure about her looks?)</div>
<div>Me:     (Well, probably... She's only nineteen and still pretty impressionable...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I should go talk to her, maybe apologize.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Damn, it's so hot outside...)</div>
<div>Me:     Fuck, that heat is gonna be the end of me...</div>
<div>Eve:    No swearing under my roof.</div>
<div>Me:     Maybe you should install an AC unit, because it's hot as hell under "your roof".</div>
<div>Eve:    Sweat builds character.</div>
<div>Me:     Ugh...</div>
<div>Me:     Hope you're right.</div>
<div>Eve:    I am.</div>
<div>Narr:   Trying to ignore the unbearable heat, you go upstairs...</div>
<div>Narr:   Finally finding yourself in front of Emily's room.</div>
<div>    Narr:   Finally finding yourself in front of Emily's room.</div>
<div>        Narr:   Without knocking, you open the door and go inside...</div>
<div>        Emily:  Oh!?</div>
<div>        Me:     *Gulp*</div>
<div>        Narr:   You stand there for a second, staring at Emily's chest.</div>
<div>        Narr:   Finally realizing exactly what you're doing...</div>
<div>        Me:     Shit! Sorry! (What the hell am I staring at?!)</div>
<div>        Emily:  It's okay. Let me just put my bra on.</div>
<div>        Me:     Yeah... Sorry, again. (I should've knocked.)</div>
<div>        Emily:  Could you help me with this?</div>
<div>        Me:     Oh? Umm... I don't know...</div>
<div>        Emily:  Pretty please?</div>
<div>        Me:     *Sigh* Okay.</div>
<div>        Narr:   Reluctantly, you get behind her and hook her bra together.</div>
<div>        Emily:  Thanks!</div>
<div>        Narr:   Again, your eyes involuntarily move south.</div>
<div>        Me:     (Fuck off, brain! STOP!)</div>
<div>        Narr:   As you move a step back...</div>
<div>        Narr:   Deciding to be a gentleman, you announce your presence at the door.</div>
<div>        Emily:  Who is it?</div>
<div>        Me:     It’s me, Em. Can I come in?</div>
<div>        Emily:  If you need to...</div>
<div>Emily:  And? Did you need something?</div>
<div>Me:     I just wanted to check...</div>
<div>Emily:  Check in on me? Aww, that's sweet!</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah...</div>
<div>Emily:  Anything else?</div>
<div>Me:     We good?</div>
<div>Emily:  No. (Did he forget what he said already?)</div>
<div>Me:     Why not?</div>
<div>Emily:  Because... (Because you said that I'm not hot!)</div>
<div>Emily:  (And I can't have that!)</div>
<div>Narr:   As a thought pops into her head, she sits on her bed.</div>
<div>Emily:  (Hmm... Maybe I could show him how I AM hotter than this "Jane.")</div>
<div>Emily:  Could you help me with something?</div>
<div>Me:     I guess. What is it?</div>
<div>Emily:  Let me just get something under my bed first.</div>
<div>Narr:   Slowly, she slides onto the floor.</div>
<div>Emily:  (This will be so much fun!)</div>
<div>Emily:  So much stuff down here...</div>
<div>Me:     *Gulp*</div>
<div>Emily:  Where is it.... (Hope you're getting a good, hard, look!)</div>
<div>Emily:  There you are!</div>
<div>Emily:  Ugh! Shit...</div>
<div>Emily:  [m!t]... I think I'm stuck. (Hhh, yeah... So stuck...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Pretending like she's getting out, Emily starts wiggling her ass...</div>
<div>Emily:  Can you help me get out of here, please?</div>
<div>Me:     Uhh... (Why didn't she put on any pants... That bikini is...)</div>
<div>Emily:  Hello?</div>
<div>Narr:   You cautiously move behind her as she keeps swinging her hips.</div>
<div>Me:     (She really did grow up.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I mean, look at that...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Get those thoughts out of your head, [m!t]!)</div>
<div>Narr:   Naturally, you're unable to stop yourself from stiffening up.</div>
<div>Me:     (Fuck! Not again...)</div>
<div>Emily:  Can you, like... Pull me out or something?</div>
<div>Me:     Umm... Yeah, sure. (I already lost count of how many erections I had today.)</div>
<div>Me:     But how?</div>
<div>Emily:  Just grab my hips and pull. Duh!</div>
<div>Me:     Right.</div>
<div>Narr:   Grabbing her hips...</div>
<div>Narr:   You start pulling.</div>
<div>Emily:  Harder!</div>
<div>Me:     O-Okay!</div>
<div>Narr:   After a little nudging, Emily is still "stuck".</div>
<div>Emily:  Pull harder!</div>
<div>Me:     I'm pulling!</div>
<div>Emily:  Ahhh... Harder!</div>
<div>Narr:   Getting a little pissed, you pull with all your strength...</div>
<div>Narr:   Since she wasn't really stuck, just pretending...</div>
<div>Narr:   Your strength surprises her, and she flies out from underneath the bed.</div>
<div>Narr:   As you land on your ass, her ass lands on your... Crotch.</div>
<div>Emily:  Uhh! (Is that his...)</div>
<div>Narr:   For a moment, neither of you move.</div>
<div>Emily:  (He got hard?!)</div>
<div>Narr:   Suddenly, she springs up.</div>
<div>Me:     (Shit! Did she feel my boner?)</div>
<div>Emily:  Umm, thanks. (So much for not being hot enough, hehehe.)</div>
<div>Narr:   With her confidence back, Emily just sprawls onto her bed.</div>
<div>Me:     Didn't you need my help with something?</div>
<div>Emily:  Already got it.</div>
<div>Me:     What? I don't get it.</div>
<div>Emily:  Doesn't matter. (Oh, you're so clueless...)</div>
<div>Me:     Umm... Okay.</div>
<div>Me:     Guess I'll leave you to it then.</div>
<div>Emily:  Yeah... Byee!</div>
<div>Me:     (That was strange...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Was she... Teasing me?)</div>
<div>Me:     (Nah. She couldn't have... Why would she do that?)</div>
<div>Narr:   As you're finishing up your inner monologue, Kiara pops out of the bathroom.</div>
<div>Me:     Oh, hi!</div>
<div>Kiara:  It's so fucking hot in here...</div>
<div>Kiara:  Eve should install an AC...</div>
<div>Kiara:  I just had a shower, and I'm already getting sweaty...</div>
<div>Me:     "Sweat builds character".</div>
<div>Kiara:  Hah! Bullshit.</div>
<div>Me:     *Chuckle* (Agreed, bullshit!)</div>
<div>Me:     Yaaawn... (I'm so tired.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I only got a few hours of sleep...)</div>
<div>Narr:   With your eyes already closing, you go to your room and get into your bed.</div>
<div>Me:     (I could take a quick nap.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Yeah, just to rest my eyes a little...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Finally, exhaustion takes over, and you fall asleep.</div>
<div>Narr:   A few hours later...</div>
<div>Me:     Hmphh... (It's already dark outside? This was more than a quick nap...)</div>
<div>Narr:   You check your phone and notice that it's 2AM.</div>
<div>Me:     (Woah! I slept that long? Damn...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Wonder why no one woke me up for dinner.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Guess they just didn't wanna bother me.)</div>
<div>Me:     (How is it still so hot, this late?!</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* (I'll just go grab some water...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Still a little blurry-eyed, you exit your room...</div>
<div>Narr:   Go downstairs...</div>
<div>Narr:   And into the kitchen.</div>
<div>Narr:   After rummaging around the fridge a little, you pour yourself a glass of water.</div>
<div>Me:     *Glug* *Glug* *Glug*</div>
<div>Me:     (Blessed be, H2O.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Okay, back to bed...)</div>
<div>Narr:   As you're leaving the kitchen, you notice Eve coming down the stairs.</div>
<div>Me:     Hi, Eve.</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh, [m!t]! You startled me!</div>
<div>Eve:    What are you doing up?</div>
<div>Me:     I got thirsty.</div>
<div>Me:     How come no one woke me up?</div>
<div>Eve:    Sorry, when I saw you sleeping, I didn't want to wake you.</div>
<div>Me:     Oh, thought so. It's okay.</div>
<div>Me:     Aaand, why are you still up?</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh... Uhhh...</div>
<div>Eve:    I couldn't sleep, so thought I'd go for a walk.</div>
<div>Me:     Something bothering you? Want me to come with you?</div>
<div>Eve:    No, no... It's just so hot in here, I could use some air.</div>
<div>Me:     I get it.</div>
<div>Eve:    Anyway, you should go back to bed. The patients will arrive first thing in the morning.</div>
<div>Me:     Yes, ma'am. Good night.</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckle* Night.</div>
<div>Narr:   Arriving back in your room, it doesn't take long for sleep to take you...</div>
<div>Eve:    Hey.</div>
<div>Me:     Hmph?</div>
<div>Eve:    Sweetie, wake up.</div>
<div>Me:     Huh?</div>
<div>Me:     What time is it?</div>
<div>Eve:    It's 7 AM.</div>
<div>Eve:    Time to wake up.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah... (I had such a strange dream...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Still not fully awake, you don't notice the morning wood you currently have.</div>
<div>Narr:   Unlike you, Eve does...</div>
<div>Eve:    Umm... (He's hard again? I should definitely just ignore it.)</div>
<div>Me:     What's the matter?</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh?! Uhh... Nothing! (How am I supposed to ignore a bulge that big?!)</div>
<div>Me:     You sure?</div>
<div>Eve:    Yeah, yeah, it's nothing. (It looks so big...)</div>
<div>Eve:    (Now I wonder what it ACTUALLY looks like... Hhh, silly me!)</div>
<div>Me:     (Why does she keep looking down?)</div>
<div>Narr:   A little confused, you glance where her eyes were "pointing" at...</div>
<div>Me:     Oh, shit!</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckle* Don't worry, it's only natural.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah... (Not really! Especially with the dream I had...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I think the image of her in lingerie got burned into my mind.)</div>
<div>Eve:    Soooo...</div>
<div>Narr:   You interrupt her attempt to change the subject.</div>
<div>Me:     When are the idiots--sorry, "patients" getting here? (Heh...)</div>
<div>Eve:    Don't call them idiots. They're just, well... unadjusted to the real world.</div>
<div>Eve:    And they need our help.</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, I know... (She didn't get the joke...)</div>
<div>Me:     Fine, when are the PATIENTS getting here?</div>
<div>Eve:    They should be here in an hour or so.</div>
<div>Me:     Great.</div>
<div>Eve:    I'm going to go make you some breakfast.</div>
<div>Me:     Awesome! Thanks, Eve.</div>
<div>Eve:    Don't mention it. See you downstairs.</div>
<div>Me:     See ya'.</div>
<div>Narr:   As she leaves, you get up and get dressed.</div>
<div>Narr:   Leaving your room...</div>
<div>Narr:   You make your way towards the bathroom.</div>
<div>    Narr:   You make your way towards the bathroom.</div>
<div>        Narr:   *Knock* *Knock*</div>
<div>        Kiara:  Occupied!</div>
<div>        Me:     You done soon? Gotta pee!</div>
<div>        Kiara:  I'm in the shower, I'll be done in a few minutes.</div>
<div>        Me:     Okay.</div>
<div>        Narr:   With nothing else to do, you wait in front of the bathroom for a few minutes.</div>
<div>        Narr:   Soon after, Kiara opens the door, wearing nothing but her lingerie.</div>
<div>        Narr:   Racy lingerie, at that.</div>
<div>        Kiara:  Oh?! You're still here?!</div>
<div>        Me:     *Gulp* I told you, I gotta pee... (What is she wearing?!)</div>
<div>        Kiara:  Well, don't just stand there, go pee.</div>
<div>        Kiara:  (I'll have to get used to him being around... Should've taken some clothes to the bathroom with me.)</div>
<div>        Me:     Oh, right! Going! Sorry, I'm still a little sleepy.</div>
<div>        Kiara:  Riiight... (Wait, was he checking me out?)</div>
<div>        Kiara:  (Hah! Can't really blame him.)</div>
<div>        Narr:   Covered up a lot less than she maybe should be, Kiara strolls towards her room.</div>
<div>            Narr:   Covered up a lot less than she maybe should be, Kiara strolls towards her room.</div>
<div>                Narr:   Unable to control yourself, you turn your head...</div>
<div>                Me:     (Why is she walking around dressed like that?)</div>
<div>                Me:     (Isn't it a bit too revealing?)</div>
<div>                Narr:   Kiara enters her room, but looks at you for a bit before closing the door.</div>
<div>                Me:     (Fuck, I hope she didn't notice...)</div>
<div>                Narr:   Pretending nothing happened...</div>
<div>        Narr:   Forgetting to knock first, you open the door...</div>
<div>        Kiara:  Eeek!</div>
<div>        Me:     Shit! Sorry!</div>
<div>        Narr:   Almost instantly, you turn around.</div>
<div>        Kiara:  What the hell, [m!t]?!</div>
<div>        Me:     Sorry! I didn't think it was occupied.</div>
<div>        Kiara:  *Sigh* Learn to knock.</div>
<div>        Me:     I really had to pee.</div>
<div>        Me:     Why didn't you just lock the door?</div>
<div>        Kiara:  I didn't expect someone would come in without knocking.</div>
<div>        Me:     You're right, my bad. Won't happen again.</div>
<div>        Kiara:  It doesn't matter now. Mind going outside so I can get dressed?</div>
<div>        Me:     Right! Sure!</div>
<div>        Narr:   Obediently, you leave the bathroom.</div>
<div>        Me:     (Really should have knocked...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (I'll just wait in my room until she's finished.)</div>
<div>        Narr:   A few minutes pass...</div>
<div>        Narr:   You hear Kiara walking down the hall and the sound of her bedroom door closing.</div>
<div>Narr:   You go inside the bathroom.</div>
<div>Me:     Ahhh...</div>
<div>    Narr:   Suddenly, you hear the door swing open...</div>
<div>    Me:     Gaahhh!</div>
<div>    Narr:   Kiara's jump-scare makes you piss all over your leg.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Hah! See? Not cool.</div>
<div>    Me:     I pissed all over myself!</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Sorry!</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Byee!</div>
<div>    Me:     What the hell, Kiara?!</div>
<div>    Kiara:  I said, sorry! (I didn't expect he'd still be taking a piss...)</div>
<div>    Me:     Not cool! Not cool at all!</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Well, think of it as getting a taste of your own medicine.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  You'll get over it. ([m!t] is hung? Like, really hung?! Since when?!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Now I have to take a shower...)</div>
<div>    Narr:   You go to your room for a fresh change of clothes.</div>
<div>    Narr:   After a quick shower, you get dressed...</div>
<div>    Me:     (Hope they won't be complete idiots.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (But I'd say that's just wishful thinking.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (The amount of stupidity in the world is only increasing...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (So... Guess I'm fucked...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Oh, well... Better just accept my fate...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Hmmm...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Maybe plants really ARE farming us...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Giving us oxygen until we eventually drop dead, turning into mulch they can consume...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (This is really taking a while...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Finally...)</div>
<div>    Narr:   Zipping up your pants...</div>
<div>    Narr:   You wash your hands.</div>
<div>Narr:   And leave the bathroom.</div>
<div>Me:     (Damn... It's already getting pretty hot...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Making your way downstairs...</div>
<div>Narr:   Eve suddenly pops out from around the corner.</div>
<div>Eve:    Could you please go and wake Emily up?</div>
<div>Me:     Sure.</div>
<div>Narr:   Seconds later, you're outside her room.</div>
<div>Narr:   Gently, you knock on the door.</div>
<div>Me:     Emily?</div>
<div>Narr:   No answer...</div>
<div>Me:     Emily!</div>
<div>Narr:   Again, no answer...</div>
<div>Me:     I'm coming in.</div>
<div>Narr:   Opening the door, you notice Emily lying on her back, her bedsheets all over the floor.</div>
<div>Me:     (Shit! Her boob fell out of her bra!)</div>
<div>Narr:   From downstairs, you hear Eve yelling...</div>
<div>Eve:    Did you wake her up?!</div>
<div>Me:     Working on it!</div>
<div>Me:     Emily!</div>
<div>Me:     (You gotta be kidding me...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Unsure if it's a good idea, you walk closer to her.</div>
<div>Me:     Emily, wake up!</div>
<div>Narr:   No response...</div>
<div>Me:     Ugh!</div>
<div>Me:     (What do I do?)</div>
<div>    Me:     (What do I do?)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Should probably fix her bra before waking her up.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (I really hope she doesn't wake up...)</div>
<div>        Narr:   You move your hand closer...</div>
<div>        Narr:   Gently grab her bra...</div>
<div>        Narr:   And pull it up.</div>
<div>        Emily:  Mmmm...</div>
<div>        Narr:   Finally, you poke her forehead.</div>
<div>        Me:     Wake up!</div>
<div>        Emily:  Mmmmm...</div>
<div>        Emily:  Hmph...</div>
<div>        Me:     Time to wake up...</div>
<div>        Emily:  Wha... Already?</div>
<div>        Me:     Umm... Yeah.</div>
<div>        Emily:  What time is it?</div>
<div>        Me:     It is--was 7 AM, about twenty minutes ago.</div>
<div>        Me:     Breakfast will be ready soon.</div>
<div>        Emily:  Ughhh...</div>
<div>        Emily:  It's too early...</div>
<div>        Me:     Yeah, yeah. See ya' downstairs.</div>
<div>        Emily:  *Yawn* Yeah...</div>
<div>        Narr:   With that, you leave her bedroom.</div>
<div>        Narr:   You poke her forehead.</div>
<div>        Me:     Wake up!</div>
<div>        Emily:  Mmmmm...</div>
<div>        Emily:  Hmph...</div>
<div>        Me:     Time to wake up...</div>
<div>        Emily:  Wha... Already?</div>
<div>        Me:     Umm... Yeah.</div>
<div>        Emily:  What time is it?</div>
<div>        Me:     It is--was 7 AM, twenty minutes ago.</div>
<div>        Me:     Breakfast will be ready soon.</div>
<div>        Emily:  Ughhh...</div>
<div>        Emily:  It's too early...</div>
<div>        Narr:   Instinctively, your eyes jump towards her chest.</div>
<div>        Me:     (Do I say something?)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Nah, I don't wanna make a big deal out of it. Better just leave...)</div>
<div>        Me:     See ya' downstairs.</div>
<div>        Emily:  Yawn! Yeah...</div>
<div>        Narr:   With that, you leave her bedroom.</div>
<div>        Emily:  (Oh? Did my boob fall out while I was sleeping?)</div>
<div>        Emily:  (Why didn't he say anything?)</div>
<div>        Emily:  *Giggle* (He probably just wanted to stare at it... Pervert.)</div>
<div>        Emily:  (Oh, well... "Oopsy".)</div>
<div>Narr:   Trying not to think about what just happened, you make your way down the stairs...</div>
<div>Narr:   And into the kitchen.</div>
<div>Eve:    Did you wake Emily up?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah...</div>
<div>Me:     Is there any coffee?</div>
<div>Eve:    Huh?</div>
<div>Me:     What?</div>
<div>Eve:    Since when do you drink coffee?</div>
<div>Me:     Since I'm in college and have to study all night long.</div>
<div>Eve:    *Chuckle* Okay, coffee it is. (He's so grown up...)</div>
<div>Narr:   She pours you a cup.</div>
<div>Eve:    Here you go. Careful, it's hot.</div>
<div>Me:     Thanks, Eve.</div>
<div>Me:     Hey, Eve, I'm not that hungry. I'll just go chill on the couch.</div>
<div>Eve:    But...</div>
<div>Me:     I'll eat later. Don't worry.</div>
<div>Narr:   As you sit down...</div>
<div>Narr:   You hear Emily yell from upstairs.</div>
<div>Emily:  I think I can see them!</div>
<div>Narr:   Everyone gathers in front of the house, waiting for the van.</div>
<div>Kiara:  Didn't you say they were here?</div>
<div>Emily:  I meant, any second now.</div>
<div>Kiara:  So where are they?</div>
<div>Eve:    I think I can hear the van.</div>
<div>Me:     (I hope there aren't more than five idiots aboard.)</div>
<div>Narr:   The van doors open.</div>
<div>Me:     (Here we go... What do we have first... An animal abuser?)</div>
<div>Me:     (Perhaps a dendrophile...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Maybe a...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Whaaa?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (I-It's a...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Girl?!)</div>
<div>Narr:   Before your brain has time to even process what just happened...</div>
<div>Me:     (Another girl?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (This is, umm... Unexpected!)</div>
<div>Me:     (Holy shit! Another one?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (Is that it? No guys this year? How?! Why?!)</div>
<div>Narr:   The girls line up next to the van...</div>
<div>Kiara:  (What the fuck?!)</div>
<div>Emily:  (Weee! So cool!)</div>
<div>Eve:    (This year will be different, that's for sure.)</div>
<div>Me:     (This is gonna be interesting...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Eve takes a step forward.</div>
<div>Eve:    Hello, girls. Welcome to Camp Red Falls.</div>
<div>noname Hi!</div>
<div>Eve:    I'm doctor Daniels. And I will be your caretaker for the duration of your stay here.</div>
<div>Eve:    You can go unpack first. Once you're done, we'll meet in front of your residences.</div>
<div>Eve:    Take the girls to their cabins.</div>
<div>Me:     Umm, yeah! Sure.</div>
<div>Me:     So... Please come with me!</div>
<div>Me:     (Well, this is unexpected...)</div>
<div>Me:     (How come we only have female patients this year?)</div>
<div>Narr:   As the girls follow you, you give them the basic tour of the place...</div>
<div>Me:     This is the main building... That's where the staff sleeps.</div>
<div>Me:     Over yonder is our community house...</div>
<div>Me:     You'll have private and group sessions there, among other things.</div>
<div>Me:     The lake is clean, and you can swim in it whenever you have time off.</div>
<div>Me:     And...</div>
<div>Naomi:  Hey, I'm Naomi, and you're kinda hot.</div>
<div>Naomi:  Are you also a patient? (Dibs, I saw him first!)</div>
<div>Me:     Uhh, no... I work here... (Did she just call me "hot"?)</div>
<div>Naomi:  So, you'll be around?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, I'll be around. But I can't--</div>
<div>Naomi:  Great! Then we'll get to know each other better. You'll love my company, I'm sure.</div>
<div>Me:     Aha, right... (Who is this chick? She starts hitting on me the moment she arrives?)</div>
<div>Me:     (I mean, not that it doesn't build up my ego a little... She's smoking hot, but...)</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* (Guess you can't expect normal behavior in this damn place.)</div>
<div>Me:     (They are getting rehabilitated, after all...)</div>
<div>Me:     (This one's probably a nymphomaniac or some shit like that.)</div>
<div>Naomi:  Something wrong? You don't enjoy my company?</div>
<div>Me:     No, no, nothing like that. I just...</div>
<div>Naomi:  Duuuh... Of course you enjoy my company. I mean, who doesn't?</div>
<div>Me:     (Not a nympho, but a fucking narcissist...)</div>
<div>Me:     *Nervous chuckle* Yeah, must be it... (How self-absorbed can you get?)</div>
<div>Naomi:  So... I was thinking. Why don't you show me around later? Give me a private tour, hmm?</div>
<div>Violet: Naomi, you can't talk to the staff like that... (I mean, he is cute, but still...)</div>
<div>Naomi:  Maybe you can't, fatty.</div>
<div>Naomi:  Who are you to tell me what I can or can't do, huh?!</div>
<div>Violet: I didn't mean...</div>
<div>Naomi:  Just shut up, Violet! Ugh, all brawn, no brain...</div>
<div>Belle:  *Chuckle* Not even five minutes in, and they're already bickering like children...</div>
<div>Stacy:  Indeed...</div>
<div>Belle:  So? What are you in here for?</div>
<div>Stacy:  Fire.</div>
<div>Belle:  Ooh, a matchstick enthusiast! We'll have so much fun!</div>
<div>Belle:  Tell me what happened.</div>
<div>Stacy:  I... May have gone overboard while recruiting followers.</div>
<div>Belle:  "Followers"?</div>
<div>Stacy:  Yes, the Puncturing Flame.</div>
<div>Belle:  And what's that?</div>
<div>Stacy:  It's a religion. In short, we worship fire and its beauty.</div>
<div>Stacy:  Interested? Would you consider joining us?</div>
<div>Belle:  Ah, I see... S-Sounds interesting, I'll think about it.</div>
<div>Belle:  (Oh God, I can't believe I'm in the same boat as these weirdos...)</div>
<div>Stacy:  *Sniff* *Sniff* Do I smell BBQ? Where's the campfire?</div>
<div>Violet: At least I'm not an empty, manipulative bitch!</div>
<div>Naomi:  Wanna repeat that, fatty?!</div>
<div>Me:     LADIES, ENOUGH!</div>
<div>Narr:   As you raise your voice, all of them freeze up.</div>
<div>Me:     Good. Let's get you settled, then.</div>
<div>Me:     You'll have plenty of time to rip each other's throats out during your stay.</div>
<div>Me:     Moving on... These are your new homes.</div>
<div>Me:     You'll each be sharing one with another person.</div>
<div>Naomi:  Share? But there are three cabins, why can't I go solo in the third cabin?</div>
<div>Me:     Because it's good practice. Getting to know one another, sharing the rehabilitation experience...</div>
<div>Naomi:  Fucking stupid... I want my own place.</div>
<div>Me:     It's also because those are the rules. (Shit! I forgot about the guidelines completely.)</div>
<div>Stacy:  Calm down, Naomi. You cannot escape the prophecy, anyway.</div>
<div>Naomi:  *Grumble* Fine! I'm taking that one!</div>
<div>Naomi:  Come, Stacy, you should join me. You seem like a fun roomie, unlike fatty here...</div>
<div>Stacy:  Sure. I do not believe the Pheonix-Lotus would mind.</div>
<div>Me:     ("Prophecy"? "Phoenix-Lotus"? What the fuck is she talking about?)</div>
<div>Me:     Anyway, it's unlocked. Keys are in the lock, on the inside.</div>
<div>Me:     Take your time and get settled.</div>
<div>Narr:   Without delay, Naomi briskly goes towards the cabin, with Stacy following suit.</div>
<div>Belle:  Guess that leaves us two. (At least I'm not grouped with that flame-natic.)</div>
<div>Violet: Yeah, okay...</div>
<div>Belle:  You gonna pick us up later?</div>
<div>Belle:  (Hmm, Naomi sure knows how to quickly separate the wheat from the chaff, he is quite handsome...)</div>
<div>Me:     Probably, but you have time to get comfortable until then.</div>
<div>Belle:  Oh, lovely. Well, can't wait to see you again.</div>
<div>Me:     ("Can't wait to see me"?)</div>
<div>Narr:   Somewhat dumbfounded by her choice of words, you just stand there.</div>
<div>Narr:   Wondering if this girl just hit on you as well.</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* (It's gonna be a long-ass summer...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I better go get The Guidelines from my room.)</div>
<div>Narr:   Finally managing to squeeze some words out...</div>
<div>Me:     Umm, yeah... Bye.</div>
<div>Belle:  Byee!</div>

<div>    Me:     (Where should I go?)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Where should I go?)</div>
<div>Me:     (A key? Wonder what it opens...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Guess I'll find out soon enough.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (I haven't seen Kiara since the patients arrived. She must be holed-up in her room.)</div>
<div>    Narr:   Approaching her room, you knock.</div>
<div>    Me:     Kiara, you here?</div>
<div>    Narr:   Not hearing a response, you open the door...</div>
<div>    Narr:   And enter her room.</div>
<div>    Me:     Kiara? (Where the hell is she?)</div>
<div>Me:     (A notebook?)</div>
<div>Me:     (No, it's Kiara's diary?!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (No, it's Kiara's diary?!)</div>
<div>        Me:     (It's Kiara's diary. I wonder what she wrote...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Maybe she mentioned me...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (We're still somewhat distant because of that one time...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Maybe I can find out how she feels.)</div>
<div>        Me:     ...</div>
<div>        Me:     (Well, Kiara, it's your fault for leaving it out in the open like this...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (It's like you want someone to read it.)</div>
<div>        Narr:   You pick up her diary and begin flipping through its pages.</div>
<div>        Narr:   The pages are mostly filled with uneventful days spent at Red Falls...</div>
<div>        Narr:   Some mentions of Eve, but nothing out of the ordinary.</div>
<div>        Me:     (This was a few years back. Just before college...)</div>
<div>        Narr:   At last, you notice a passage with your name in it.</div>
<div>        Narr:   ("Fateful night"?! "All these feelings"?!...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Does Kiara still have a thing for me? But she also says she'd like it if things returned to normal...)</div>
<div>        Me:     Fuck... (Maybe I shouldn't have read this.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Now I have to make sure she doesn't notice anything weird about my behavior.)</div>
<div>        Me:     *Sigh* Problem after problem, huh?</div>
<div>        Narr:   You place the diary back in the same position as when you found it.</div>
<div>        Narr:   You learned more than you hoped for, perhaps even more than you wished for...</div>
<div>        Narr:   But, nonetheless, you got some juicy info out of it. </div>
<div>        Me:     (I better leave the room. Don't wanna get caught with my pants down...)</div>
<div>        Narr:   Before anyone sees you, you leave Kiara's room.</div>
<div>        Me:     (It is quite tempting, but...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (I really shouldn't read her diary, even though I'm curious as hell.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (I might find out something I'd rather not know...)</div>
<div>        Narr:   Not wanting to get caught, you leave Kiara's journal alone.</div>
<div>Me:     (Hey! That's a photo with all of us!)</div>
<div>Me:     (I should get a copy made, too.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Everyone looks so happy.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Eve looks gorgeous...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Kiara and Emily too.)</div>
<div>Narr:   And then it hits you...</div>
<div>Me:     (Wait, where am I?!)</div>
<div>Me:     I'm not in the photo...</div>
<div>Me:     (SERIOUSLY?! I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT IN THE PHOTO?!)</div>
<div>Me:     (But how? Why? When was this taken?)</div>
<div>Me:     (By the look of their clothes, it was definitely taken during the summer. Probably at Red Falls, too.)</div>
<div>Me:     (It doesn't say...)</div>
<div>Me:     (The time stamp must be on the back of the picture.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I'll have to open up the frame somehow, if I wanna get to the bottom of this.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (I'll have to open up the frame somehow, if I wanna get to the bottom of this.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (As much as I'd like to know why...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (It's probably best to remain ignorant.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Not to mention, if Kiara finds out I've been snooping around her room, she'll strangle me in my sleep.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation as to why I'm not "part of the gang"...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (I can't just let this slide. I at least gotta know when it was taken.)</div>
<div>        Narr:   Poking around a little, you try opening the picture's frame.</div>
<div>        Me:     (It's stuck...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Fine, I'll just claw my way in.)</div>
<div>        Narr:   *Snap*</div>
<div>        Me:     Perfect... (I broke it...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (At least it's on the back side. Hope she doesn't notice.)</div>
<div>        Me:     *Sigh* (What's done is done. Might as well find out...)</div>
<div>        Me:     ("August"? Two years ago?)</div>
<div>        Me:     (That's when I started college, right? And before that...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Before that, Kiara and I...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Shit. I just left after creating so much chaos...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (No wonder I'm not in the photo.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (No wonder Kiara's been acting weird.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Is that what I think it is?)</div>
<div>Narr:   You crouch down to take a closer look.</div>
<div>Me:     (It really is my old volleyball!)</div>
<div>Me:     (Wow, she still has it after all this time.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Aww, man. I'd love to play again.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I still remember that time we played... All those girls in swimwear, jumping around, sweating...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Wait, Kiara was also there with me! That's right, we played on the same team.)</div>
<div>Me:     Huh... (She looked amazing...)</div>
<div>Me:     (We've had a lot of good memories together, haven't we?)</div>
<div>Me:     (I just hope she thinks of them as fondly as I do.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Her perfume bottles.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Looks expensive...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I doubt she bought them all by herself...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Wouldn't be surprised if she got one from a previous patient or something like that.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Do I...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Do I...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Yeeeeah, I'd rather not...)</div>
<div>        Me:     (Snooping around her room is weird enough as it is.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (No need to sniff a girl's perfume like some creep.)</div>
<div>        Me:     ...</div>
<div>        Me:     (Shit, Jane was right... Maybe I am a creep.)</div>
<div>        Me:     Ah, well...</div>
<div>Me:     *Sniff* *Sniff*</div>
<div>Me:     Ahhhhh... (Smells wonderful.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Just like Kiara...)</div>
<div>Me:     ...</div>
<div>Me:     *Cough* (I should probably put that back.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Haven't been in her room for years...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I wonder if anything's changed.)</div>
<div>Narr:   Without much thought, you try opening the door...</div>
<div>Me:     Hmm, locked. (Now I'm even more curious.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Wait, maybe that key...)</div>
<div>Narr:   Cautious not to make too much noise...</div>
<div>Narr:   You insert the key into the lock and turn it.</div>
<div>Me:     (Lucky me, it's the right one.)</div>
<div>Narr:   You open the door and walk into the bedroom.</div>
<div>Me:     Hmm... Looks more or less how I remember. (Not sure what I was expecting...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Maybe the key's just for privacy's sake, 'cause of the patients and all.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Well, can't hurt to look around.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Hmm, nothing interesting in here.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Emily?)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Looks like she's talking to one of the patients. Wonder what it's about...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (She seems really into it...)</div>
<div>    Me:     Huh. (Guess Emily picked up some social skills while working here.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (What's that?)</div>
<div>    Me:     (A box? Not sure if I wanna know the contents...)</div>
<div>    Me:     Ehh, might as well.</div>
<div>    Narr:   You pull the box out.</div>
<div>    Me:     (What's behind door number one?)</div>
<div>    Me:     ...</div>
<div>    Me:     ...</div>
<div>    Me:     (I'm not sure what I expected to find in a box hidden under the bed...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Oh, God. I can feel the mental scars growing.)</div>
<div>        Me:     (What's that sound outside?)</div>
<div>Me:     (Haven't been in her room for years...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I wonder if anything's changed.)</div>
<div>Narr:   Without much thought, you try opening the door...</div>
<div>Me:     Hmm, locked. (Now I'm even more curious.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I'll have to find the key somewhere.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Asking for it would probably sound weird.)</div>
<div>Narr:   As you enter the kitchen, you notice Kiara hanging around.</div>
<div>    Me:     Hey, Kiara.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Hi, have you finished your chores?</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah, the girls are getting settled in.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  And The Guidelines?</div>
<div>    Me:     Uhhhhhh...</div>
<div>    Kiara:  *Chuckle* Don't worry, I won't bite.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Just make sure to give a copy to every patient.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Well, I have some shit to do, I'll talk to you later.</div>
<div>    Me:     'Kay, later.</div>
<div>    Me:     (Shit, it's Kiara. I better not slip up.)</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Eeeek! Oh, it's you... You scared me. (Still not used to him popping up.)</div>
<div>    Me:     My bad.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  What are you skulking around the house for?</div>
<div>    Me:     Oh, ummm, nothing. Just wandering around, that's all.</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Mhm, I bet. (He's hiding something...)</div>
<div>    Me:     Really!</div>
<div>    Kiara:  You know I've been working here for years, right? I can tell when something's up.</div>
<div>    Me:     (She doesn't believe me... I'll have to come up with a better excuse.)</div>
<div>    Kiara:  Hellooo?</div>
<div>        Kiara:  Hellooo?</div>
<div>            Me:     You don't look too cheery. Something wrong?</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Hmm, can't hide anything from you, can I?</div>
<div>            Me:     You read me, I read you..</div>
<div>            Kiara:  *Sigh* Yeah, I guess something's wrong.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Nothing serious, but annoying, nonetheless.</div>
<div>            Me:     What about?</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Don't you worry your pretty little head. I'll manage.</div>
<div>            Me:     You can tell me if something's bothering you. I'll listen.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  I know you would.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Maybe I'll even take you up on that offer, but another time. Okay?</div>
<div>            Me:     Whenever you need me.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  I'm glad you're here. I missed you.</div>
<div>            Me:     I missed you too.</div>
<div>            Narr:   You sit there for a moment, exchanging looks in silence.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Right, ummm...</div>
<div>            Me:     Okay, good talk.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  *Chuckle* Yeah, I have some shit to do anyway, I'll see you later.</div>
<div>            Me:     Later, Kiara.</div>
<div>            Narr:   With that, she leaves the kitchen.</div>
<div>            Me:     (Phew, that was a close one.)</div>
<div>            Me:     Ohhh... Uhhh... Ummm... Ehhh... (Fuck, I can't come up with anything on the spot.)</div>
<div>            Kiara:  I think I know what this is about. (He's still thinking about it...)</div>
<div>            Kiara:  I tried to put it in the past, but I see you're still struggling to do the same.</div>
<div>            Me:     No, it's not about... (Hit the nail on the head. You're too good at this, Kiara...)</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Spare me. I can see you cringing anxiously around me...</div>
<div>            Kiara:  There's only one reason...</div>
<div>            Me:     ...</div>
<div>            Kiara:  I thought you had grown up, maybe I was wrong.</div>
<div>            Me:     Kiara, I...</div>
<div>            Kiara:  It's fine. I was naïve thinking everything would return to how it once was.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  I'm ready to let go, but I shouldn't just expect you to do the same.</div>
<div>            Me:     Kiara, stop!</div>
<div>            Narr:   Raising your voice catches her off-guard.</div>
<div>            Me:     Yes, it crosses my mind here and there, but I don't care about that anymore.</div>
<div>            Me:     We've known each other forever, for fuck's sake.</div>
<div>            Me:     And seeing how you're still bringing it up doesn't really give off the impression of coming to grips with it.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  What would you know about anything? About me?</div>
<div>            Kiara:  You left for college, didn't even call or anything.</div>
<div>            Kiara:  If it weren't for Christmas, I probably wouldn't have seen you at all!</div>
<div>            Me:     *Sigh* I did kind of run away, didn't I?</div>
<div>            Me:     But I'm here now, and I'm tired of avoiding you.</div>
<div>            Me:     I want our relationship to be normal, "like it was".</div>
<div>            Kiara:  We'll see about that...</div>
<div>            Kiara:  Oh, and [m!t]... I hope you really mean what you're saying.</div>
<div>            Narr:   Without uttering another word, Kiara walks away.</div>
<div>            Me:     *Sigh* Fuck... (It's still bothering her. Can't say I don't feel the same...)</div>
<div>Me:     (I've wasted enough time already... I should just get the guidelines before anyone notices.)</div>
<div>Me:     Ah, there they are. (Thought for a second I lost them.)</div>
<div>Narr:   You take another look at the papers...</div>
<div>Me:     Hmm... (They haven't changed much.)</div>
<div>Me:     (Same old crappy guidelines that mostly protect the institution, not the patients, blah-blah-blah...)</div>
<div>Me:     Oh? (There are a few new ones I haven't seen before...)</div>
<div>Me:     "Romantic relations are strictly forbidden", "All personnel must not become emotionally attached to patients"...</div>
<div>Me:     (What the fuck is this? New rules? And pretty obvious ones at that...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Did something happen? Maybe that's the reason why all the patients are female this time.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I'll ask Eve about it.)</div>
<div>Narr:   After going through the guidelines again, you leave to distribute them.</div>
<div>Narr:   Walking down the stairs, you bump into Eve.</div>
<div>Narr:   Definitely not wanting her to notice the guidelines being delivered just now, you hide them behind your back...</div>
<div>Eve:    Have you finished everything I asked?</div>
<div>Me:     Uh-huh...</div>
<div>Eve:    And the patients are in their designated cabins?</div>
<div>Me:     "Designated"? I just brought them there, no one told me anything about "designated rooms".</div>
<div>Eve:    Of course they have designated rooms, what did you expect?</div>
<div>Me:     I didn't think it was that important...</div>
<div>Me:     I'll go deal with it right away.</div>
<div>Eve:    Oh, and...</div>
<div>Me:     What?</div>
<div>Eve:    Those guidelines you're hiding should've been in their rooms before the patients got here...</div>
<div>Me:     ...</div>
<div>Me:     *Sigh* (They've probably already settled in. This is gonna be a pain...)</div>
<div>Me:     (Where do I even go first?)</div>
<div>Narr:   A little hesitant, you head towards the cabins...</div>
<div>    Narr:   You approach the first cabin...</div>
<div>    Narr:   As you get closer, you hear voices from inside.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  No, no, no! I told you, like, five times already, be careful with that and put the lighter away!</div>
<div>    Narr:   You knock on the door.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  I doubt the Phoenix-Lotus cares about such trivialities...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  These "trivialities" are worth more than your whole family's net worth!</div>
<div>    Narr:   You knock again.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  And what the fuck is a "Phoenix-Lotus", anyway?!</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Your deity obviously doesn't have a sense of fashion!</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Can't tell the difference between a dress and a top?</div>
<div>    Stacy:  The Phoenix-Lotus surely has a more refined fashion taste than you...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Are you seriou--</div>
<div>    Narr:   Everything goes quiet for a brief moment...</div>
<div>    Narr:   Before the door swings open.</div>
<div>    Narr:   With Naomi standing on the other side of the threshold.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Sorry, handsome, but not right now. We're busy.</div>
<div>    Me:     Hey, can I borrow you for a second?</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Mmmm, couldn't wait, could you? (Of course. How could he resist?)</div>
<div>    Me:     That's not...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Alright, guess I have a minute... (I should do my research, anyway.)</div>
<div>    Me:     I came to give you these guidelines.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Oh, wonderful...</div>
<div>    Me:     *Sigh* And... I'll have to ask one of you to move.</div>
<div>    Narr:   The moment she hears this, Naomi's flirty behavior shifts to annoyance...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Excuse me? Why?</div>
<div>    Me:     The sleeping arrengements were predetermined, it seems.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  What does that even mean?</div>
<div>    Me:     It means you have to swap roomies.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Why?! That's such a waste of time. Plus, I don't want to.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  I'm fine with Stacy... Even though she's...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Well, the way she is.</div>
<div>    Me:     I'm not the one calling the shots, sorry.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  I literally unpacked this second.</div>
<div>    Me:     (As far as I could tell, Stacy unpacked your shit while you were giving orders.)</div>
<div>    Me:     Again, sorry for the inconvenience, I wasn't briefed about it.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  *Tsk* Very unprofessional...</div>
<div>    Me:     *Sigh* Tell me about it.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Hmm... (I was expecting him to get all defensive, but he just agreed. He's not even sarcastic.)</div>
<div>    Naomi:  You can ask Stacy if she's willing to move.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  'Cause I'm definitely not moving an inch.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Who am I paired up with, anyway?</div>
<div>    Naomi:  I hope it's not that gorilla.</div>
<div>    Me:     If you mean Violet, I'm afraid it is.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  HUH?! That makes no sense!</div>
<div>    Naomi:  We're total opposites, how is that supposed to work?!</div>
<div>    Me:     I told you, I'm not the one calling the shots...</div>
<div>    Me:     Plus, you two might have more in common than you think.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  That's fucking bullshit, I'm not doing it.</div>
<div>    Me:     You're here for rehabilitation, not a vacation.</div>
<div>    Me:     Going out of your comfort zone might actually do you good.</div>
<div>    Narr:   Naomi looks annoyed, but remains silent.</div>
<div>    Narr:   Whether she saw logic in your words or you struck a nerve, she stops complaining.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Fine... But Stacy is the one moving. I'm staying here. (Again with the fucking "comfort zone"...)</div>
<div>    Me:     It's all the same to me. I'll leave you two to figure it out.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  [m!t]!</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah?</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Do you have a girlfriend?</div>
<div>    Me:     Huh? Why do you ask? (A little too upfront, but okay...)</div>
<div>    Naomi:  I'm just curious. (Plus, I'm interested in what type of prey I'm dealing with.)</div>
<div>    Me:     Lookin' to apply for the position?</div>
<div>    Narr:   Your words catch Naomi off-guard, causing her to blush a little.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  No, don't be so full of yourself.</div>
<div>    Me:     *Chuckle* If you must know, though. Yes, I'm seeing someone.</div>
<div>    Me:     You know, we're having fun.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Good for you. (He's perrrfect!)</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Bye now.</div>
<div>    Me:     Sorry, I still need to talk to Stacy for a moment.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  ...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Humph...</div>
<div>    Narr:   After a brief second, she moves out of the way and lets you enter.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  Hello, sir. Have you come to join The Puncturing Flame?</div>
<div>    Me:     Uhh, no, not right now.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  Shame... We could use more people with good genes like yourself.</div>
<div>    Me:     ("Genes"?! The fuck is she talking about?)</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah, maybe some other time.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  Alright, we'll wait until the flame calls to you.</div>
<div>    Me:     Umm... Yeeeaahhh...</div>
<div>    Me:     So, there was a misunderstanding with the housing.</div>
<div>    Me:     You should've been paired with Belle, doctor's orders.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  I see... Yes, there were signs around her, should've expected this.</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeeeaahhh, ummm... Can you maybe move your stuff over to the other cabin?</div>
<div>    Stacy:  I doubt Naomi's the type that pleases others, so...</div>
<div>    Stacy:  I'll comply.</div>
<div>    Me:     Excellent, glad you're so... cooperative.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  Of course, cooperation is the first step in leading a successful flock.</div>
<div>    Me:     Right... (A "flock"?! The hell?!)</div>
<div>    Me:     Anyway, take this... House rules and guidelines. Read them.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  Awww, thank you! This will prove excellent kindling.</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeeeaahhh, try to read it before you burn it.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  *Giggle* I can't promise anything.</div>
<div>    Me:     Alright, I'll be around if you need help.</div>
<div>    Stacy:  May The Charred Kings lead your way.</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeeeaahhh, I'll follow them wherever...</div>
<div>    Naomi:  You finally done?</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah, all done. I'll see you later.</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Take care, handsome.</div>
<div>    Me:     "Handsome"?</div>
<div>    Naomi:  Surprised? You shouldn't be.</div>
<div>    Me:     *Chuckle* (Hasn't heard of subtlety, has she?)</div>
<div>    Narr:   As you turn around to answer...</div>
<div>    Narr:   You notice Stacy lying on her bed.</div>
<div>    Me:     (Whoa!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (I can see under Stacy's skirt!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Holy shit, she's not wearing any underwear!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Fuck, I shouldn't be looking at that!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (I really gotta stop getting myself in these situations...)</div>
<div>    Narr:   Finally, you leave their cabin.</div>
<div>    Narr:   You approach the second cabin...</div>
<div>    Narr:   And knock on the door.</div>
<div>    Me:     (No one's answering, are they even inside?)</div>
<div>    Narr:   Leaning towards the door...</div>
<div>    Narr:   You take a peek.</div>
<div>    Narr:   Immediately noticing one of the girls inside, getting undressed.</div>
<div>    Me:     (Holy shit! She's half naked!)</div>
<div>    Me:     (Wow, nice tits...)</div>
<div>    Me:     (I really shouldn't, though...)</div>
<div>    Me:     ...</div>
<div>    Me:     (I better move. If she sees me, all hell will break loose.)</div>
<div>    Me:     (I'll just knock on the door a bit harder, this time.)</div>
<div>    Narr:   Making sure not to overdo it, you bang on the door.</div>
<div>    Narr:   After a few seconds...</div>
<div>    Belle:  Just a second!</div>
<div>    Narr:   One of the girls greets you on the doorstep.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Yes?</div>
<div>    Me:     Hello, hope I'm not intruding.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Not at all, come in, come in.</div>
<div>    Belle:  I'm Belle, by the way.</div>
<div>    Me:     (Oh, right. We never got a chance to properly meet.)</div>
<div>    Me:     [m!t].</div>
<div>    Belle:  How can I help, [m!t]?</div>
<div>    Me:     There was a misunderstanding with the cabins.</div>
<div>    Belle:  What do you mean?</div>
<div>    Me:     Nothing serious, but you'll have to swap roomies.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Oh, okay. So? Who should I pair up with?</div>
<div>    Me:     The religious one, Stacy.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Ahh, okay... Should I stay here or move? (Just hope I won't wake up on fire...)</div>
<div>        Me:     You stay here, she'll move in with you.</div>
<div>        Me:     Doesn't matter, you can figure it out later, but you should be staying with her.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Okay, I don't mind.</div>
<div>    Me:     Oh, right. Almost forgot to give you this...</div>
<div>    Belle:  What is it?</div>
<div>    Me:     Just The Guidelines. You should read them.</div>
<div>    Narr:   After a quick look...</div>
<div>    Belle:  "Romantic relationships are strictly forbidden", "All personnel must not become emotionally attached to patients"...</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah, those are new. Not sure how or why those happened, but...</div>
<div>    Belle:  Guess your hands are tied then... Too bad. (Huh, I smell a challenge.)</div>
<div>    Me:     First off, I'm seeing someone...</div>
<div>    Me:     Second, I shouldn't even have to mention how "irregular" it is for patients to have intimate relationships with their doctors.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Oh? You're a doctor, [m!t]?</div>
<div>    Me:     No, but that--</div>
<div>    Belle:  Then why trouble yourself, if it doesn't affect you?</div>
<div>    Me:     The Guidelines say "personnel", not "doctors". Rules apply to all.</div>
<div>    Belle:  *Giggle* I won't tell if you won't...</div>
<div>    Me:     *Sigh* (Who the hell are these chicks?)</div>
<div>    Me:     Hmm, I just noticed...</div>
<div>    Me:     Where's the purple-haired one, uhh...</div>
<div>    Belle:  You mean, Violet? Said she needed some fresh air.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Sports type, can't hold still for five minutes...</div>
<div>    Belle:  Hasn't even unpacked. *Chuckle*</div>
<div>    Me:     Okay, I'll go look for her. Thanks.</div>
<div>    Belle:  Don't mention it. You should come and visit more often. *Wink*</div>
<div>    Me:     I'll think about it. (Jesus, am I seeing things or are they all hitting on me? Is that the reason they're here?)</div>
<div>    Me:     (She said that Violet went outside...)</div>
<div>    Narr:   Looking around, you spot Violet doing some stretches.</div>
<div>    Narr:   Coming closer, you see that she's quite fit.</div>
<div>    Narr:   Surprisingly, you failed to notice that until now.</div>
<div>    Me:     Hey, I've been looking for you. (Damn, her body looks pretty firm.)</div>
<div>    Violet: Oh, ummm... "Looking for me"? (That's kinda sweet. Does he like--) </div>
<div>    Me:     I need to give you these guidelines. You should read them.</div>
<div>    Violet: Oh, right, of course. (Yeah, why would he...)</div>
<div>    Me:     I haven't introduced myself properly...</div>
<div>    Violet: It's [m!t], right?</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah, how did you know?</div>
<div>    Violet: I-Uhhhh... You mentioned it when we got here.</div>
<div>    Me:     Did I? I don't remember.</div>
<div>    Violet: I'm sure I heard you say it.</div>
<div>    Me:     Oh, okay then. And you're Violet?</div>
<div>    Violet: That's me.</div>
<div>    Me:     Well, nice to meet you, Violet.</div>
<div>    Me:     What are you doing here, anyway?</div>
<div>    Violet: Umm, I needed some space, and I had to do some maintenance.</div>
<div>    Me:     "Maintenance"?</div>
<div>    Violet: Yeah, stretching, running, stuff like that.</div>
<div>    Violet: The ride was pretty long, and I don't like it when my body gets stiff.</div>
<div>    Me:     Yeah, you do look like you train a lot. (She's obviously fit, but she's still curvy as fuck.)</div>
<div>    Violet: Really? Oh... *Chuckle* Ummm...</div>
<div>    Me:     Belle mentioned something about sports... Are you a professional?</div>
<div>    Narr:   Violet's playful expression is quickly replaced by a saddened look.</div>
<div>    Violet: *Sigh* Yeah... I was, actually... For a while...</div>
<div>    Violet: But then...</div>
<div>    Narr:   You spot some bitterness in her words.</div>
<div>    Me:     Ah, I see... It's okay, I won't pry.</div>
<div>    Me:     Also, is it too forward to ask why you're here, Violet? I mean, you seem completely normal to me.</div>
<div>    Me:     (Unlike the rest...)</div>
<div>    Violet: Oh, umm... *Nervous chuckle* I wouldn't be here if I was "normal".</div>
<div>    Violet: Everyone has a reason, mine is... Maybe a bit different. ("A bit"?)</div>
<div>    Me:     Care to share?</div>
<div>    Violet: Uhhhhh, I'd rather not talk about it... (It'll definitely scare him off.)</div>
<div>    Me:     Okay, I understand.</div>
<div>    Me:     Well, you have The Guidelines. Read them when you have the chance.</div>
<div>    Violet: I will, I promise.</div>
<div>    Me:     Good, I'll leave you to it then.</div>
<div>    Me:     You should go back to camp, we'll probably have a meeting soon.</div>
<div>    Violet: Okay, I won't be long.</div>
<div>    Narr:   After the quick talk, you go back to camp.</div>
<div>Narr:   The girls are briefed, and The Guidelines distributed - all loose ends are tied.</div>
<div>Me:     (Guess that's it for now.)</div>
<div>Me:     (I should probably find Eve, see what's next on the "to-do list".)</div>
<div>Narr:   On your way back, you see Eve heading towards you.</div>
<div>Me:     Hi.</div>
<div>Eve:    Hey there, spying on our patients, hmm?</div>
<div>Me:     Yeah, nothing's more attractive than unstable chicks.</div>
<div>Me:     You're in a good mood today.</div>
<div>Eve:    I'm always in a good mood, comes with age.</div>
<div>Narr:   Eve approaches the patients' residences and calls out...</div>
<div>Eve:    Laaaaadieees! If you're done unpacking, I'd like you to meet us outside.</div>
<div>Narr:   Turning back around to face you...</div>
<div>Eve:    I hope you're ready. The main event is about to begin.</div>
<div>Narr:   One by one, the girls slowly congregate around Eve.</div>
<div>Eve:    Hello again, everyone.</div>
<div>Eve:    I see everyone has already gathered, very good.</div>
<div>Eve:    We're glad you applied to Red Falls. That was probably one of the better choices you'll make in your life.</div>
<div>svi *Scoff*</div>
<div>Eve:    Over the course of the next two months, we'll slowly get to know each other.</div>
<div>Eve:    We have lots of activities planned for you, so please, relax and enjoy your stay.</div>
<div>Eve:    Get to know one another, staff included.</div>
<div>Eve:    Push through your inadequacies and become better people.</div>
<div>Eve:    That is all.</div>
<div>Eve:    Does anyone have any questions?</div>
<div>Narr:   Without waiting for an answer...</div>
<div>Eve:    No? Good.</div>
<div>Eve:    Alright, your first order of business for getting to know one another...</div>
<div>Eve:    Is to strip naked.</div>
