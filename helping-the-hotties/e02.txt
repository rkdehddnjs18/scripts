    s "*Chuckle* No, silly. You read the cracks."
    s "And these cracks are saying \"one reindeer\"..."

    m "So you came here to check your very near future?"
    m "Isn't it a bit too late already?"
    n "The corners of her lips stretch into a gentle smile."
    s "There's also this..."
    n "And she raises her other arm, with something in hand..."
    m "What's that?"
    s "I believe the Jamaicans call it \"Da 'Urrrb\"."
    m "You're shitting me!? You have weed!?"
    m "(How the fuck did she sneak it in? I'm sure I checked all her stuff!)"

    s "This is a place of peace and tranquility..."
    s "No loud voices or angry words allowed."
    m "Oh, in that case..."

    m "But how? Where?"
    s "Instead of wasting time asking questions that have no answer, wouldn't you rather join me?"
    m "When you put it that way..."
    n "Wanting to take your mind off things, you sit beside Stacy."
    n "Soon, she passes the blunt to you."
    s "Your reward..."
    m "*Inhale*"
    m "My reward? *Exhale*"

    s "Something wrong? *Exhale*"

    s "Why bother then?"

    m "Stacy, how come you're part of this cu-Religion? "
    s "We share a lot of interests and they are the only ones that truly get me."
    s "I'd probably be alone otherwise... Or dead..."

    m "I-I-Uhh.... Yes. Yes, I think you're cute."
    s "Well, I think you're cute too."
    n "Whether it was due to \"Da 'Urrrb\" or some other reason..."
    n "You and Stacy have something you can only think of as a spark..."
    n "Suddenly, she kisses you."
    n "But you don't immediately back off."
    n "Instead, you pull her closer and she sits on your lap."
    n "Stacy gets you immediately in the right mood."
    n "Her lips feel hot and wet."
    n "The accumulation of all today's events, combined with the sheer intensity of this moment..."
    n "It makes you lose yourself completely..."
    n "Almost in a trance, you reach for her ass and grab it tightly."
    s "Mmmm..."
    n "Almost clawing at your back, Stacy presses herself against you..."
    n "Squishing her soft tits on your chest."
    n "It's more than enough to get anyone's blood pumping."
    n "And so, sitting on your lap, she feels you getting hard."
    n "That feeling, of your large cock pressed against her..."
    n "It only causes her to want more..."
    n "Soon, she starts riding and grinding you over your clothes."
    s "*Pant* You're so big..."
    m "And you're so hot..."
    s "Careful, our religion takes that compliment very seriously."
    n "Again, you share a kiss."
    n "The kiss drowns you in ecstasy, making you forget about everything..."
    n "Everything..."
    s "Mmm..."
    n "Wrapped in each others arms, you continue kissing and enjoying each others' touch."
    n "Unbeknownst to you, the campfire makes you stick out like a sore thumb."
    n "Indeed, it would be quite hard {i}not{/i} to notice you..."
