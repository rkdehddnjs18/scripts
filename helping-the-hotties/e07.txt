m "They were talking about an eclipse on TV this morning."
k "Really? That's weird..."
em "What's weird?"
k "That [m!t] dreamed of an eclipse a day before one is going to happen."
em "When was the first time you felt your psychic powers developing?"
m "What?"
em "Can you tell us what will happen today?"
em "Or where I'll be living in 5 years?"
k "Probably in a trailer park."
m "I'm not seeing into the future, Em."
em "How can you be sure?"
k "Did you talk to Stacy in the dream?"
m "No. I tried calling her name, but she didn't notice."
m "She was just staring into the forest."
k "How weird."
em "They're {i}all{/i} weird."
m "That's not true."
em "Well, you have a crush on them. So..."
em "You're kinda biased."
m "I'm trying to get to know them."
m "Because they're human beings, Emily. And they're here to get some help."
k "How noble of you..."
m "Mmm, something smells good."
em "Here you go. Bon appetit!"
m "*Laughs* Em!"
k "You're so immature..."
em "Don't be such a prude, Kiara!"
em "What do you think we'll be doing today?"
m "God knows what Eve has planned for me. You two always have it easy."
k "That's not true! I'm doing all kinds of errands."
em "I'm not. Losers!"
k "That's because Eve doesn't trust you."
em "Either way, I have more free time than both of you, {i}combined{/i}."
m "And how do you use it?"
em "In all {i}sorts{/i} of ways..."
m "You {i}sure do{/i}..."
m "Anyway, see you two later. Eve's expecting me."
n "Having finished your breakfast, you go to Eve's office."
mo "Come in!"
mo "Ah, [m!t]!"
m "Hey, Eve."
mo "Please, sit down."
mo "How have the last couple of days been for you?"
m "A bit busy."
mo "I know I've worked you hard."
mo "Which I presume isn't what you had in mind when you came here."
m "Yeah, I didn't imagine myself cleaning the lake at 4 AM."
mo "Well, that time it was a punishment."
mo "A justified one, I believe."
m "I won't argue with that."
mo "What about Kiara and Emily?"
mo "Have they been treating you right?"
m "(Kiara's mouth has certainly been treating me well...)"
m "They are alright."
m "Emily has been really energetic and playful."
m "Kiara is as serious as ever."
mo "*Chuckles* That sounds about right."
m "And you?"
mo "Me what?"
m "Have you been feeling better?"
mo "Oh yes, I've started to relax more."
mo "I've been really anxious ever since my apprentice left."
mo "Seeing you be such a great help has alleviated most of my worries."
m "I'm glad."
m "Smiling suits you better, anyway."
mo "Oh, does it?"
m "It brings out your eyes."
mo "I didn’t realize you noticed these kinds of things."
m "I can be perceptive sometimes."
mo "So it seems. That’s quite a nice quality to have."
mo "Especially with the ladies."
m "I haven’t practiced it that much, to be honest."
m "(She must have figured it out by now.)"
mo "Are you sure?"
m "(Fuck.)"
m "I'm positive."
    mo "What do you think of the change in this year’s patients?"
    m "You mean the fact that they're all women?"
    mo "Exactly."
    mo "Four charming women must be a lot for you to handle."
    m "*Chuckles* You make it seem like I’ve never been around women before."
    mo "Well, you’re young and impressionable."
    mo "It wouldn’t be so unusual for you to succumb to their charm."
    m "They {i}are{/i} a lot, I have to admit."
    m "But, I'm managing it."
    mo "Some of them seem to affect you more than others."
    m "Huh?"
    mo "The dream..."
    m "Oh! I mean, I'm--"
    m "It's just that--"
    mo "Yes?"
    m "You know how it is with dreams..."
    m "They are a distorted version of reality."
    mo "(It’s cute seeing him squirm like this.)"
    mo "(I still haven’t seen him do anything suspicious, but...)"
    mo "(I better keep an eye on him.)"
    mo "Relax, [m!t]."
    mo "I'm just teasing you."
    mo "It's perfectly normal."
    m "It is?"
    mo "You have been spending time with the patients."
    mo "Their experiences have rubbed off on you."
    mo "And made their way into your dreams."
    m "They are quite peculiar."
    m "The girls."
    mo "They certainly are."
    mo "What was all that with Emily and Kiara this morning?"
    m "Oh, that was just Emily being silly."
    m "She gets a kick out of teasing Kiara and making her uncomfortable. "
    mo "Why does she think Kiara was {i}really{/i} sympathetic to your experience?"
    mo "It seemed to me she was hinting at something."
    m "(Ah, shit! Poker face, [m!t].)"
    m "(Poker. Face.)"
    m "I honestly have no idea."
    m "God knows what happens in that head of hers."
    m "Emily isn’t the most serious person here."
    mo "I must agree with you there."
    mo "Maybe some of your maturity rubs off on her."
    m "I seriously doubt it."
m "So, why am I here?"
m "More chores to be done today?"
mo "Actually, no."
mo "As I’ve mentioned before, I’d like you to be more involved in the actual therapy."
m "Oh!"
m "Are you sure about that?"
m "It’s only been a couple of days, and I don’t know the girls that well."
m "(Just play it cool...)"
mo "You have to start somewhere."
mo "So I think this is the best time for that."
mo "But, I don’t want to force anything on you if it makes you uncomfortable."
m "(Hmm, spending more time with the girls would certainly be a treat.)"
m "(I’d get to know them more.)"
m "(I wouldn’t need to resort to eavesdropping so much.)"
m "(Plus, it will give me less time to do boring chores.)"
mo "In general, it would look great on your resume."
mo "Impress a professor or two."
m "(Oh, yeah. That’s also a plus.)"
m "Of course I’d be interested, Eve."
m "Are you sure about this, though?"
m "I’ve only recently started psychology classes, so I don’t have much experience."
mo "You’d be supervised at first, of course."
mo "Pay attention to their needs, and think about what kind of therapy suits them best."
mo "Nothing huge."
mo "I’d be there, too, of course. To guide you."
mo "Then with time, you’d become more independent."
mo "Soon after that, you'd get to guide their individual sessions."
m "(I’ve already started doing {i}something{/i} like that.)"
m "This all sounds good to me."
m "Thank you for including me in your work."
m "I have so much to learn, and I couldn’t get a better teacher than yourself."
mo "Aww, you’re really sweet, [m!t]."
mo "I {i}do{/i} love teaching."
mo "Anyway, I’ll have the notes prepared for you."
mo "Swing by my office a bit later so we can go over them. "
m "(Sweet!)"
m "Great! I'm excited!"
m "See you later, Eve!"
mo "Bye, [m!t]!"

    v "At least, it sounded like it came from that direction."
    v "Oh!"
    m "Oh?"
    v "Yeah, I just remembered something."

    v "Oh, [m!t]. You're too sweet..."
    m "You are too. You're the sweetest girl at camp."

    v "It helps me balance my mind and emotions."
    v "And, I think it's pretty healthy in general."
    m "How long have you been doing yoga, Violet?"
    v "Hmm..."
    v "I'd say around 10 years, now."
    m "*Chuckle* So, do you think you could call yourself a yogi by now?"
    v "Oh, no."
    v "I'd need to fully dedicate my life to it."
    v "At this point I'd rather focus on becoming an athlete again."
    v "But, maybe someday I {i}could{/i} open a yoga studio."

mo "Hello, [m!t]."
mo "Having a good day?"
m "I am. How are you?"
mo "Ready for the girls' sessions."
mo "How are you, [m!t]?"
m "I'm fine, thanks."
mo "Hmm..."
mo "Can you come with me?"
m "Uh, sure. What do you need my help with?"
mo "Oh, nothing."
mo "I just thought the girls would benefit from you joining the first session."
m "(This could be interesting...)"
m "Sure, I'll play ball."
mo "Great. I'm happy to hear it."
        m "(Where was she?)"
        m "(I didn't see her anywhere around camp since this morning.)"
        m "(She looks worried.)"
mo "Hello, everyone!"
mo "I hope you all used your free time well."
b "Can't we get the whole day off? Therapy is boring..."
mo "You're here for a reason, Belle."
mo "Unless you want to visit us every summer, I suggest taking our work here seriously."
b "Doing {i}this{/i} again is the last thing I want to do."
nao "Me too."
mo "Today we'll be doing paired therapy."
nao "A what?"
mo "You'll be divided into two groups for the first session today."
mo "[m!t] will be joining us today."
m "I am?"
v "Dr. Eve, I'm not sure I'll be comfortable with someone else joining the therapy."
mo "I assure you it's going to be alright."
mo "[m!ct] has developed an interest in therapy, so I believe this could be a great learning opportunity for him."
mo "As for you, discussing your problems around someone new might help you overcome them much faster."
mo "The details why you came won't be discussed in this session."
mo "Is everyone okay with this?"
b "I have no problem with [m!t] {i}helping us.{/i}"
nao "Neither do I."
v "If we won't be discussing the details, I'll be okay with that."
mo "Stacy?"
s "Hmm?"
mo "Would you be okay with that?"
s "With what?"
mo "With [m!t] joining our session today."
s "Sure. Whatever."
mo "For the first session, Belle and Stacy will come with us."
mo "Naomi and Violet, you have some free time until we're finished."
mo "I ask that you wait at the gazebo..."
mo "...so we can have some privacy."
v "Of course, Dr. Eve."
mo "Lets begin, shall we?"
mo "Let me just take a seat, ladies."
b "[m!ct], you can squeeze between us."
m "Umm, I'll sit next to Dr. Eve. Three's a crowd."
b "Not always. I like threesomes."
b "I mean, hanging out with two more people."
b "I didn't mean sex. Although... that's {i}totally{/i} fun."
mo "Belle, we've talked about this..."
b "What?"
mo "Stacy, how have you been feeling today?"
s "I'm fine."
mo "You seem a bit..."
mo "Preoccupied with your thoughts."
s "I'm always preoccupied with my thoughts."
mo "Did anything specific happen?"
s "No."
m "(She really {i}is{/i} acting weird...)"
mo "Well, we're here to listen if you need us. Let's continue."
mo "Today's session will be focused on your opinions of each other."
mo "Do you think that's important?"
s "Probably."
mo "Can you elaborate further?"
s "Not really."
m "(What's going on with her? She was never {i}this{/i} gloomy.)"
mo "Belle?"
b "I never cared what anyone thought of me. It's such a waste of time."
mo "Would you be bothered if someone openly disliked you?"
b "Of course, but I don't see why anyone would dislike me."
b "I'm a pleasure to hang out with."
b "Right, [m!t]?"
m "(This isn't funny anymore. Eve's getting more suspicious...)"
m "Yeah, you're fun."
mo "Stacy, do you enjoy Belle's company?"
s "I don't mind her."
mo "Can you single out one of her most positive personality traits and one less positive one?"
s "Hmm... I like that she's always in a good mood."
s "That feels nice when I'm not feeling so great."
s "Sometimes she's judgmental of my religion, though..."
s "Which is mildly annoying."
b "Being in a cult is totally fine with me. I'm not one to judge people."
s "See? That's what I'm talking about!"
b "What?"
s "It's not a cult! You referring to it like that just proves my point!"
mo "Stacy, I believe we can discuss this in a more calm way."
b "I didn't..."
mo "This type of therapy isn't meant to be offensive, or hurtful."
s "I feel like every time we talk about me, you're judging me because of my religion."
s "I do live within its prescribed norms, but that's not my whole life."
s "Nor my whole persona."
mo "I'm sure Belle didn't mean it like that."
s "Dr. Eve?"
s "I'm not feeling up for today's session. May I be excused?"
mo "I'd like you to stay and give me 5 more minutes."
mo "Can you describe how you're feeling right now?"
s "On edge would be the most appropriate description."
mo "Did anything specific happen or is it just a momentary feeling?"
s "I'm not sure. It's just how I'm feeling at the moment."
s "It's been building up, I guess."
mo "Do you feel like you're receiving support here from the other girls?"
s "We don't confide in each other, really."
mo "Do you think you can build friendships here?"
s "Maybe. We'll see."
mo "Thank you for your patience, Stacy."
mo "Go rest and we'll continue this later."
m "Should someone go after her?"
mo "No, let her be. She needs to calm down."
mo "Some alone time is better for her right now."
b "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset her."
mo "It's not your fault, Belle. This was just a triggering event for her."
b "Sooo, what is [m!t]'s role in all of this?"
mo "Well, [m!t] seems genuinely interested in helping others."
mo "I wanted him to experience the field first hand and..."
mo "...maybe someday join the business."
b "Ohh. I didn't know [m!t] was interested in that..."
m "I've thought about it. Being helpful is fulfilling."
b "Well, sign me up. You can be {i}helpful{/i} to me anytime."
m "Umm, sure..."
mo "Okay, let's wrap this up."
mo "You have some time until the next session so use it as you will."
mo "Bye, Belle!"
b "Bye, Dr. Eve!"
m "Bye!"
mo "[m!ct], would you like to lead the second session?"
mo "Or would you prefer to have some time off until later?"
    mo "Or would you prefer to have some time off until later?"
        m "That sounds great!"
        m "I'd love to go."
        mo "Glad to hear it."
        mo "Let's go."
        m "I'd like to ease into this, if that's fine with you."
        m "The first session has been... a bit too much."
        m "I'm not feeling confident enough for another one."
        mo "That's okay, [m!t]. Baby steps."
        mo "Take some time off, relax."
        mo "Catch up with you later."
        m "Thanks, Eve!"
        m "Good luck. See you later!"
        m "(I should go after Stacy and check how she’s doing.)"
        m "(She really didn't seem okay. Especially after that session.)"
        m "(Although, hanging out with Belle always ends up frisky and fun.)"
        n "You continue pondering the choice."
        n "Stacy clearly needs your help."
        n "But, in a way, so does Belle."
        m "(Hmm...)"
            m "(Hmm...)"
m "(I think I should really go after Stacy...)"
m "(Who knows where she's disappeared to.)"
n "Belle notices you approaching from behind."
b "Well, well. Look who picked the {i}fun{/i} choice."
m "Unfortunately... {i}no.{/i}"
b "What? So, you don't wanna have some {i}real{/i} fun with me?"
m "Sorry, Belle. Now's not the best time."
b "Oh, you're saying later would be better?"
b "Maybe when the sun sets and everyone else is asleep?"
m "Yeah... Sure. I guess."
m "Sorry, Belle. I really have to go."
n "Passing Belle, you notice Stacy in the distance."
n "You attempt to make up the space between you and Stacy."
n "As you run after her, you try to get her attention."
m "Stacy, wait up!"
n "Stacy seems not to care so you pick up the pace to catch up to her."
s "Let me go!"
m "What's going on with you?"
s "Nothing."
m "That's not true. You can tell me."
m "You know I'll keep it between us."
s "Thank you for caring, [m!t]. But, I don't know what to tell you."
m "I'm listening..."
s "It doesn't matter. I told you already!"
m "Fine. Then, we'll stand here in silence."
n "A few minutes of awkward silence pass by..."
s "*Sigh* It's just..."
s "Everyone is really nice, but I feel like the odd one out."
s "I don't belong here. Not like the others, anyway."
m "In what way?"
s "It's more of a feeling. I'm not sure exactly why they're here."
s "We all come from different backgrounds, and have different stories."
s "But, I would say {i}my{/i} problem is different than theirs."
m "If you feel like that, why don't you talk to Dr. Eve about it?"
s "She wouldn't understand. She analyzes us from a therapist's point of view."
s "I don't think she'd truly get what I'm thinking."
m "If you feel like that, there's another possibility..."
s "Which is?"
m "No one's holding you hostage here."
m "You can leave voluntarily if this feels like it's too much."
m "I don't believe Dr. Eve would force you to do anything that makes you feel sad or angry."
s "You want me to leave?"
m "No, of course not!"
m "But, I'm sad and worried seeing you like this."
s "Awww, [m!t]! You're really sweet."
m "That was unexpected..."
s "Just wanted to thank you for being here for me. It means a lot."
m "Anytime."
m "So what are you going to do about this?"
s "I'll wait and see how things go."
s "I owe it to myself."
m "I agree. Don't rush things."
m "If it means anything, I think you're brave for doing this."
m "For wanting to do better in your life."
s "Thank you, [m!t]."
s "I'm sorry I'm such a burden."
m "You're not. Don't talk about yourself like that."
m "We can talk about less gloomy things if you want."
s "Yes, please."
m "Hmmm, how abooout..."
m "You tell me what you were like as a kid."
s "Digging deep, huh?"
m "No, I mean--"
s "Relax, I'm teasing you."
s "I was a pain in the ass."
m "Oh?"
s "I was always running around, making a mess."
s "I couldn't stay still for 5 minutes..."
m "Your parents must have lost their temper a lot."
s "You have no idea..."
m "Did you get into any accidents?"
s "A couple, yeah."
s "I remember this one time I went on the balcony and wanted to fly with an umbrella, Mary Poppins style."
m "*Laughs* No way!"
m "Did you do it?"
s "No. A neighbor spoiled all the fun by telling my mom, who was back in the garden."
m "That's crazy."
s "Yeah. How about yourself? Any wild childhood memories?"
m "Hmm, no, I was a good boy."
s "Come on! There must be something."
m "Fine. There was this one thing."
s "Yes?"
m "I stabbed myself in the eye with the straw from my Capri Sun..."
m "...after wrestling with Eve over it."
s "*Bursts out laughing*"
m "I had to go to a hospital. I wore an eye patch for like a week."
s "I haven't laughed so much in a while."
s "Thank you, [m!t]."
m "No problem. I'm glad my pain and suffering amused you."
s "I'm up for funny stories anytime."
m "Oh, then I'm going to be a goldmine to you."
m "But, that'll have to wait."
m "I have to go and take care of some things at the house."
m "I'll catch you later, okay?"
s "Sure thing. Bye, [m!t]! And thank you for cheering me up."
m "Of course. Bye, Stacy!"
m "(I think I should probably give Stacy some space...)"
m "(All day people have been asking her over and over if she's okay.)"
m "(I'd feel suffocated if that were me.)"
n "While you think, and walk..."
n "Belle approaches you from behind."
b "Well, well. Look who picked the {i}fun{/i} choice."
m "I just want to be helpful. You know?"
b "Oh, I'd love it if you made yourself helpful to {i}me.{/i}"
m "Depends on what you mean by helpful..."
b "I'm {i}very{/i} creative. Come with me."
m "Umm, okay..."
b "Make yourself comfortable."
m "(I wonder what tricks Belle has planned for me now...)"
b "What do you say we play a game?"
b "I'd like to tap into who [m!t] {i}really{/i} is..."
m "Oh, how thoughtful of you."
b "You think I'm only interested in sex?"
m "Well..."
b "It's not far from the truth, but there's more to me than that..."
m "I believe you. So... Who {i}is{/i} Belle, really?"
b "You tell {i}me.{/i}"
m "A woman with many secrets. Very generous and hard to resist."
b "Heading in the right direction..."
m "Full of surprises."
b "Mhm..."
m "Very playful and direct."
b "Not bad, [m!t]."
b "It seems like you've been paying attention..."
b "Mr. maybe-to-be-counselor, I believe I'm up next."
b "Have you ever played a game called Build a Story?"
m "No... What's it about?"
b "You start with a sentence, and I add another one. "
b "We build a story together, taking turns."
b "Why don't you start first?"
m "Hmm... Okay."
m "A strange man was sitting on a bench..."
b "...when a stunning woman approached him."
m "He seemed very preoccupied with his thoughts, and didn't notice her at first."
b "The woman sat really close to him and asked him if he's from around here."
m "\"I am. Why are you asking?\""
b "\"I just wanted to know if you know any good restaurants around. I'm starving.\""
m "The man said he knows a few places. \"There's a steakhouse just around the corner.\""
b "\"Would you like to join me? You seem like you need some company.\""
m "The man thought about it for a few seconds before replying, \"that wouldn't be such a bad idea.\""
b "At dinner, the woman asked him why he seems sad."
m "The man answered that he's recently gone through a breakup and is still processing it."
b "The woman was very charming and sweet, so by the end, the man asked her to join him for drink at his place."
m "After a couple of drinks, the woman seemed really flirty."
b "She leaned in for a kiss..."
n "He pulled her closer and they kissed passionately."
b "He couldn't resist her so he put his hand on her shirt..."
m "And gently played with her tits."
b "She wanted more so she grabbed his other hand and put it inside her panties."
m "He got turned on more by playing with her clit."
b "So she grabbed his crotch, feeling his hard on poking her hand."
b "She took it out..."
b "Wrapped her soft hands around it..."
b "And started stroking it."
b "They both enjoyed the sensations and surrendered themselves to it."
n "Suddenly, you hear noises from outside."
m "Belle, wait..."
m "I think someone's outside."
s "What's going on here?"
m "Belle and I were talking."
s "Oh, about what?"
b "Just getting to know each other more."
s "Cool."
m "I'll let you two catch up."
b "Aww, don't leave now."
s "Yeah, you can stay if you want."
m "(With a hard on? Don't think so.)"
m "It's okay. Catch you guys later..."
s "Okay, [m!t]. See you later."
b "Later, [m!t]."
m "Phew! That was close."
n "Having agreed to lead the second session, you head toward the gazebo."
n "Approaching the gazebo, you spot Violet and Naomi talking."
m "(I'm kinda nervous now.)"
m "(I’m glad Eve is here if anything goes wrong.)"
m "(They might start going at each other.)"
mo "Hello, ladies!"
mo "How is everyone feeling today?"
nao "I'd be better if it wasn't getting hotter every day."
v "It's summer. Maybe if you dressed appropriately..."
nao "And, how is that any of {i}your{/i} business?"
nao "I have delicate skin. I'm certainly not risking any sunburns."
mo "Ladies... Have you heard of the Gottman Method?"
mo "So that's a no."
mo "How about you, [m!t]?"
m "I'm with them."
mo "Okay, so... The basic idea is that unresolved conflicts are a norm and..."
mo "...can be manageable through positive communication, rather than criticism."
mo "Do you believe your communication a moment ago was positive?"
v "No..."
mo "Criticism, contempt, defensiveness and stonewalling are the four horsemen of a relationship's demise."
nao "We're not in a relationship."
mo "Relationship refers to both romantic relations, as well as platonic ones."
mo "In order for your stay here to be successful, a positive environment must be present."
mo "Naomi, wouldn't it be easier for you if you and Violet were more supportive of each other?"
nao "Of course, but..."
mo "Then that is our goal here."
mo "Attachment bonding between patients has proven to aid the success of therapy itself."
mo "So let's start with something simple."
mo "[m!ct], You can take it from here."
m "(Oh, shit!)"
mo "Remember what we spoke about earlier."
mo "You'll do great."
mo "Don't worry."
n "Slightly nervous, but determined to do well, you go on."
m "*Clears throat*"
m "Single out one positive personality trait of the other person."
mo "Let's start with [m!t]."
m "Huh?"
mo "What do you think Naomi and Violet's best features are?"
m "Umm... Ahem."
m "Violet is very polite and enjoys teaching others the beauty of physical activity."
m "Naomi seems guarded, but underneath she is tender and sweet."
nao "Awww, thank you, [m!t]!"
mo "You're very perceptive, [m!t]. Thoughtful, too."
mo "({i}Really{/i} perceptive...)"
mo "Go on, [m!t]."
m "(Okay. Think! What to ask them now?)"
m "(Oh, I got it!)"
m "Violet, it's your turn now."
v "Well, [m!t] has helped me overcome my shyness a bit. He's very sweet."
m "I meant, what's the most positive thing about Naomi?"
v "Oh! Hmm... She's... nice sometimes?"
nao "Sometimes?"
v "Maybe we started off on the wrong foot."
v "I actually haven't tried getting to know Naomi more."
v "I'm sure she has nice qualities."
v "Maybe I should try harder finding what those are."
m "Naomi?"
nao "Violet is... okay. I mean, maybe she's a bit {i}too into{/i} sports."
nao "She's sweet, though. I like that."
nao "And yeah... I haven't tried getting to know her, either."
m "Can you tell me more about why you dislike each other?"
mo "Those are nice questions, [m!t]."
m "Thank you, Dr. Eve."
m "(I have no idea what I'm doing...)"
m "(I guess I pass as a believable therapist.)"
m "(Barely.)"
nao "She's just so different from me."
nao "Dresses differently, talks differently..."
m "Is that a reason to openly dislike someone, and be rude to them?"
nao "No, but..."
m "Violet?"
v "I'm not sure why she doesn't like me, but it started to get annoying so I talked back."
m "Naomi, are looks more important to you than someone's personality?"
m "Do you think everyone should dress and behave the same as you?"
nao "Of course not. I mean, it would be a better looking world, but..."
m "I suggest that every day, each of you does something nice for the other."
m "It can be anything. A drawing, a nice gesture, an act of service..."
m "Utilize your interests and hobbies and make an effort to do nice things every day."
m "Does that sound achievable to you?"
nao "Sure. I can write her a poem or something."
v "You write?"
nao "Yes, a bit."
v "Will you read me something you've written?"
nao "Sure. I'll show you later."
v "Awesome!"
m "I'm glad you've decided to be more open-minded, and gentler."
m "I'd like to conclude the first part of today's sessions."
m "You're both excused, and may organize your time as you want."
mo "Very professional of you, [m!t]."
mo "What do you think, ladies!"
mo "Did [m!t] do well?"
nao "He did {i}really well.{/i}"
v "I quite enjoyed this session, Dr. Eve."
v "I wouldn't mind [m!t] taking part in it again."
m "Thank you {i}very{/i} much."
n "You cast a glance at Eve, looking to see her reaction."
m "(She seems happy.)"
m "(More points earned.)"
mo "Ladies, you're free until the next session."
mo "[m!ct], are you going back to the house or?"
m "It’s a nice day out, I was thinking of spending it outside."
mo "Very well. Have fun!"
mo "I expect you to be on your best behavior, of course."
m "Absolutely."
mo "Bye!"
m "Bye, Dr. Eve!"
nao "Bye!"
v "Bye, Dr. Eve!"
v "[m!ct], would you like to join me for a walk?"
nao "I was going to ask the same thing."
        m "I'll join Violet for now. I'll come find you later, Naomi."
        nao "No need. You had your pick."
        m "Naomi!"
        v "That escalated quickly."
        v "Anyway..."
        v "How did you like participating in the session, [m!t]?"
        m "It was pretty interesting."
        m "I'm glad you and Naomi have decided to be nicer to each other."
        v "We'll see how that goes."
        m "You don't think it will work?"
        v "I'm having doubts. But, let's wait and see."
        v "Maybe I misjudged her."
        v "I certainly want to do better. But if she doesn't do the same..."
        m "Yeah, I get it."
        m "Let's hope for the best, then."
        v "It's really hot outside."
        m "(Mmmmmm...)"
        v "Would you like to join me for a swim?"
        m "Huh?"
        m "Of course. But I'll have to go change first."

m "What is it?"
mo "Let's go outside and get some fresh air."
m "Sure. Lead the way."
mo "Ah, nothing like a gentle summer breeze."
m "You didn't bring me out here just to enjoy the breeze?"
m "Did you?"
mo "No, no."
mo "I wanted to check in with you."

mo "But, there's nobody who can step in for me."
m "Sounds like you'd like me to be that person."
mo "Only if you wanted to, of course."
mo "And, you would need further training."
m "Yeah, I wouldn't like to dive right into it."
mo "Oh, no. Psychiatry isn't something one {i}dives into.{/i}"
mo "Therapy needs forethought to not damage the patients' already-fragile minds."
m "Yeah, I understand the fragility of the patients' minds."
m "I've seen that first-hand over the years..."
mo "You've become something like my right-hand man, [m!t]."

m "Pretty good sandwiches, Eve."
mo "Thanks."
mo "I think I've perfected the art of the light lunch."

mo "Well, feel free to make lunch yourself, then."
mo "I would definitely appreciate the help."
m "Who knows..."
m "*Chuckle* I might consider putting on my chef's hat sometime."
mo "For the time being, you might want to put your waiter vest on."
m "Waiter vest?"
m "You never gave staff vests."
mo "I'm pulling your leg."
mo "Grab that tray of sandwiches for me, [m!t]."
mo "The patients must be getting hungry by now."
m "Well, we shouldn't leave the patients waiting, then."
mo "That's the attitude."
mo "After you."

nao "I'm really getting sick of sandwiches."
