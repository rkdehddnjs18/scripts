Narr:	You drift in the realm of sleep, blissfully.
Narr:	However, a strange sensation begins to grow inside you, urging you to awaken.
Me: 	(Wha--? Brain, why the hell are you doing this to me?)
Me: 	*Grumble* (What did I do to deserve such a rude awakening?)
Me: 	(How ungodly early is it, anyway?)
Me: 	(Hmm... There's some light coming through the blinds.)
Me: 	(Why is it still so dark, then?)
Narr:	You sit on the edge of the bed, in your dimly lit bedroom.
Me: 	(I should check the time...)
        Narr:	You get up from the bed, and go over to inspect your phone.
    Me: 	(Hmm... Must be dead.)
    Me: 	(I should really make a habit out of charging it from now on...)
        Me: 	(I guess I'll have to check the time on my laptop.)
        Me: 	(Wait a second...)
        Me: 	(What's that sound?)
        Narr:	Now that you're standing closer to the wall...
        Narr:	...you hear muffled sounds coming from the other side.
        Narr:	You get up from the bed, and go over to inspect your laptop.
        Me: 	(Maybe I can check the time on my laptop.)
        Me: 	(It can't also be dead.)
    Me: 	(Laptop, my old friend.)
    Me: 	(Can you help me get my bearing?)
    Me: 	(Let's see... What time is it?)
    Me: 	(What? "NULL?")
    Me: 	(I've never seen that happen...)
    Me: 	(Maybe it's just a login screen error.)
    Me: 	(What the fuck?!)
    Me: 	(I didn't take that picture!)
    Me: 	(Then... Why is it on my computer?)
    Me: 	(This is really weird...)
    Me: 	(Did I take that picture?)
    Me: 	(Was she blowing that kiss to...)
    Me: 	You wince at the thought of it... 
    Me: 	But, something stirs within you, deep down...
    Me: 	(Focus, Dennis...)
    Me: 	(Did you actually take that picture of Eve?!)
    Me: 	(No...)
    Me: 	(Am I... dreaming?)
    Me: 	(I don't think I am...)
        Me: 	(I guess I'll have to check the time on my phone.)
        Me: 	(Wait a second...)
        Me: 	(What's that sound?)
        Narr:	Now that you're standing closer to the wall...
        Narr:	...you hear muffled sounds coming from the other side.
        Narr:	You get up from the bed, and go over to the source of the sound.
        Me: 	(Why am I interested in the wall?)
        Me: 	(The wall won't tell me what time it is.)
        Me: 	(Huh?)
        Me: 	(Wait a second...)
    Me: 	(I hear something...)
    noname:	*Muffled* ...yeah!
    Me: 	(I still can't hear that well...)
    Me: 	(Hmm... Maybe I can...)
    Me: 	(I should be able to--)
    noname:	FUUUUCK! YES!
    noname:	Fuck me... Dennis...
    noname:	Punish my pussy...
    Me: 	(Holy shit, am I hallucinating?!)
    Me: 	(This is all so surreal...)
    Me: 	(Who is that?)
    Me: 	(And...)
    Me: 	(Is she really--)
    noname:	YES! FUCK ME HARDER, [m!ut]!
    Narr:	Yes, it appears that she is.
    noname:	Come get me. I know you're listening to me moan for you.
    Me: 	(How could she know?)
    Me: 	(Nothing makes sense...)
    Me: 	(This wall--)
    noname:	Dennis...
    Me: 	(Kiara?)
    noname:	I'm so close, yet so far away...
    Me: 	(It does sound like Kiara.)
    Kiara:	Come get me. Mmmm... Ooohhh...
    Me: 	(Should I really?)
    Narr:	Your hormones and conscience are currently in a "conflict for the ages."
    Narr:	As always.
        Narr:	As always.
            Narr:	It appears that your hormones won this battle.
            Me: 	(I should check to see if Kiara's okay.)
            Me: 	(She seemed a bit...)
            Narr:	Horny?
            Me: 	(...off.)
            Me: 	(What?)
            Me: 	(Why won't it turn?)
            Me: 	(Argh! This house is really falling apart...)
            Me: 	(Come on! I can't really be trapped in here, can I?)
            Me: 	*Sigh* (Guess it's not the worst place to be trapped...)
            Narr:	It appears that your conscience won this battle.
            Me: 	(I shouldn't.)
            Me: 	(Either she's doing something incredibly... "private.")
            Me: 	(Private, and very taboo...)
            Me: 	(Or, I'm just hearing things.)
            Narr:	You try to convince yourself of the latter...
            Narr:	Despite the strange feeling you can't shake, hitching a ride in your gut.
    Narr:	You get up from the bed, and go over to inspect the blinds.
    Me: 	(What the hell is going on?)
    Me: 	(Why is the sky red?)
    Me: 	(Huh?)
    Narr:	Despite how little the light outside is doing, you notice someone below...
    Me: 	(Who's that?)
    Narr:	Unfortunately, the low-light conditions obscure the person's face.
    Me: 	(Damn, I can't tell who it is...)
    Me: 	(Anyway, the bigger question on my mind is why is the sky red?!)
    Narr:	That strange sensation nags you...
        Me: 	(That feeling...)
        Me: 	(I...)
        Me: 	(I'm dreaming, aren't I?)
        Me: 	(I must be... Everything here is so surreal.)
            Me: 	(It was strange enough that my phone was dead...)
            Me: 	(Even weirder was what I saw on my laptop...)
            Me: 	(Those pictures aren't mine.)
            Me: 	(And, the noises coming from the wall...)
            Me: 	(Wait a second.)
            Me: 	(Wait, wait, wait...)
            Me: 	(The wall I heard Kiara through...)
            Me: 	(It's the bathroom!)
            Me: 	(Why would she moan my name from the bathroom?)
            Me: 	(Because she knows it shares a wall with my room?)
        Me: 	(Yeah, nothing adds up.)
        Me: 	(This... has to be a dream.)
        Narr:	Too bad you still haven't mastered lucid dreaming.
        Narr:	Otherwise, this place would be your kingdom to shape as you desire.
        Narr:	Now equipped with your awareness of the dream...
        Narr:	Your focus returns to the prevailing mystery.
        Narr:	But, a quick moment later the fleeting sensation passes...
        Me: 	(Hmm...)
        Narr:	Allowing you to forget about it almost instantaneously.
        Me: 	(Ah, never mind.)
        Narr:	Your focus returns to the prevailing mystery.
Me: 	(I really can't see who it is.)
Me: 	(And, I have a bad feeling about this...)
Me: 	(I need to go see.)
    Me: 	(Ah shit, I totally forgot...)
    Me: 	(The doorknob is stuck.)
    Me: 	(But...)
    Me: 	(Wait...)
    Me: 	(If I am actually dreaming...)
    Me: 	(Then, the doorknob isn't even real.)
    Me: 	(Hmm...)
    Narr:	A sudden, brilliant idea pops into your head.
    Me: 	(Maybe...)
    Me: 	(Maybe the door is open.)
    Me: 	(No... The door IS open.)
    Narr:	A giddy excitement wells up inside your chest.
    Me: 	(Booyah!)
    Narr:	Your hunch was right.
    Narr:	This is your mind. Your dream.
    Narr:	No door can hold you back.
    Me: 	(Bow before me, door, and tremble in your frame.)
    Me: 	(I don't have any other options.)
    Me: 	(I'd break my legs if I went out the window.)
    Me: 	(So...)
    Me: 	(Here goes nothing!)
    Narr:	Expecting the doorknob to be stuck, you give it all your strength.
    Me: 	(Hyaaa!)
    Narr:	To your surprise, the handle opens smoothly.
    Me: 	(Oh, it's not stuck anymore.)
    Me: 	(If I had given it any more strength, I might have ripped it off the door.)
Me: 	(What the hell?)
Narr:	It seems that your bedroom door has been... 
Narr:	Rerouted.
Narr:	Into some kind of shortcut leading outside.
Me: 	(Okay...)
Me: 	(Very weird...)
Me: 	(What the hell?)
Narr:	Indeed, the sky looked hellish painted in crimson light.
Me: 	(Who is that?)
Me: 	Hello?
Narr:	The silhouetted person does not seem to notice you.
Me: 	Hello?
Narr:	Although you speak, your voice is lost in a vacuum.
Me: 	(I don't think they can hear me.)
Me: 	(Come to think of it, I can't even hear my own voice when I speak.)
Me: 	(I can almost see...)
Me: 	(Is it Stacy?)
Me: 	Stacy!
Narr:	Again, your call is silent.
Me: 	(It was worth a shot.)
Me: 	Stacy?
Me: 	Are you okay?
Me: 	(It is Stacy!)
Me: 	Stacy! Where are you going?
Me: 	Stacy! Wait up!
Me: 	Stacy!
Narr:	Despite your best efforts to keep up, Stacy remains just out of reach.
Me: 	Stacy!
Me: 	Stacy! Where are you?!
    Me: 	(Wait a second.)
    Me: 	(Of course she can't hear me...)
    Me: 	(This is a dream.)
    Me: 	(There's no use in screaming.)
    Me: 	(Or running after her.)
    Narr:	As you stand there in your realization...
    Narr:	...the forest becomes blindingly bright.
    Me: 	Am I still dreaming?
    Me: 	*Gasp* Whew...
    Narr:	Now back in the waking world, you feel very dazed by the confusing dream.
    Me: 	Ugh... (I slept like shit.)
    Me: 	*Yawn* (Hopefully today will be an easy day.)
    Narr:	Deep in the pit of your stomach, you feel a sense of unease.
    Me: 	(That feeling again...)
    Me: 	*Stomach grumbles* Oh.
    Narr:	Actually, it seems that feeling in your stomach was hunger.
    Me: 	(I could go for a nice, big breakfast.)
    Me: 	(First I should wash all this nightmare sweat off of me.)
    Me: 	Stacy!
    Me: 	STACY!!!
    Narr:	As the darkness of the forest begins to wrap around you...
    Narr:	...all you can hear echoing in your mind is her name.
    Me: 	Stacy...
    Me: 	STACY!
    Narr:	Now back in the waking world, you feel as though you've been hit by a truck.
    Me: 	Ugh... (I slept like shit.)
    Me: 	*Yawn* (Hopefully today will be an easy day.)
    Narr:	Deep in the pit of your stomach, you feel a sense of unease.
    Me: 	(That feeling again...)
    Me: 	*Stomach grumbles* Oh.
    Narr:	Actually, it seems that feeling in your stomach was just hunger.
    Me: 	*Chuckle* (Guess that nightmare made me hungry.)
    Me: 	(I could go for a nice, big breakfast.)
    Me: 	(First I should wash all this nightmare sweat off of me.)
Me: 	(What?)
Me: 	(No shortcut outside, this time?)
Narr:	Not this time.
Narr:	Now, your door leads where it always has, the upstairs landing.
Me: 	(I can't wait to--)
Me: 	(Oh. I nearly forgot.)
Narr:	It seems you've finally broken the habit of not knocking before entering.
Me: 	(I guess it's empty.)
Narr:	You enter the bathroom and turn on the shower.
Narr:	Not long after, you're all cleaned up...
Narr:	...and ready to go.
Me: 	Ah! (I feel refreshed.)
Me: 	*Stomach grumbles*
Me: 	(Still hungry, though.)
Eve:	Ahh... (Peaceful morning.)
Eve:	(I'm relieved that the patients this year are more...)
Eve:	(...manageable.)
Eve:	(Hopefully it stays that way.)
noname:	Inflation is nearing record highs...
Eve:	Terrible...
noname:	...The Fed is discussing whether to increase the interest rate...
Narr:	A creak on the stairs interrupts Eve's focus on the TV.
Me: 	Morning, Eve.
Me: 	Aren't you bored by that stuff?
Eve:	Well, I think it's important to watch the news.
Eve:	So I know what's happening in the world.
Me: 	OK boomer.
Eve:	Hey, now! I'm Gen X.
Eve:	And, good morning to you too, Dennis.
Me: 	Yeah, well, "Gen X" doesn't roll off the tongue as smoothly.
Eve:	Yeah, yeah.
Eve:	Anyway...
Eve:	Did you get a good night's sleep?
Me: 	Not really...
Me: 	What's that about?
Eve:	Oh?
Eve:	That?
Eve:	Looks like there's going to be an eclipse.
Eve:	Why do you look like you've seen a ghost?
Me: 	Well...
    Me: 	Well...
        Narr:	You consider telling Eve about your dream...
        Me: 	(Maybe Eve could help me analyze my dream.)
        Narr:	But, you know that divulging too much of what happened might seem strange.
        Me: 	(I should probably keep it short, though.)
        Me: 	(I don't want any alarm bells going off in her head.)
            Me: 	(I don't want any alarm bells going off in her head.)
                Eve:	So?
                Me: 	Well, it's just kinda weird.
                Eve:	You know I'm not in the business of judging people, Dennis.
                Me: 	I know...
                Me: 	It's weird, because I had a dream about the eclipse.
                Me: 	Before I knew it would happen.
                Eve:	Strange...
                Eve:	I doubt you'll be a spoon bender by tomorrow, though.
                Me: 	I know there's a logical explanation for it.
                Me: 	But, that can't stop me from feeling weird about the coincidence.
                Eve:	Maybe it's not purely coincidence.
                Me: 	Oh, so now you're starting to change your mind?
                Eve:	Of course not.
                Eve:	I believe you heard about it somewhere, maybe the internet.
                Eve:	And, your subconscious mind weaved that bit of info into your dream.
                Me: 	Yeah, you're right.
                Me: 	It's probably nothing.
                Me: 	(I just can't shake that feeling, though...)
                Me: 	(I need to figure out how Stacy plays into all of this.)
                Me: 	(I should make sure she's doing okay...)
                Eve:	*Unintelligible*
                noname:	On the day of the Summer Solstice.
                Eve:	Dennis.
                noname:	What a treat!
                Eve:	Dennis!
                Me: 	Shit!
                Me: 	Sorry!
                Me: 	I guess I zoned out a little bit.
                Eve:	Yeah, you did.
                Me: 	I'll clean it up.
                Eve:	Well?
                Me: 	Well, it was all just so vivid.
                Me: 	But, also really surreal and strange.
                Eve:	Would you care to go into a little more detail, Dennis?
                Me: 	I'll try, but the details are getting foggier every second that goes by.
                Me: 	So, I woke up in my bed, thinking it was early morning.
                Me: 	I went over to the curtains, and opened them to see...
                Eve:	To see what?
                Me: 	To see that the sky was blood red, and darker than usual.
                Me: 	It was an eclipse.
                Eve:	Huh. That is spooky.
                Me: 	It gets weirder.
                Me: 	I saw someone. Below my window.
                Eve:	Who was it?
                Me: 	Well, at first, I couldn't really tell.
                Me: 	They were silhouetted because of the dimness of the sun.
                    Me: 	I checked my phone to see what time it was...
                    Me: 	But, it wasn't working.
                    Me: 	I pressed the unlock button, but the screen didn't respond.
                    Eve:	That's not so strange.
                    Eve:	The battery could have been dead.
                    Me: 	I went to my laptop to check the time, but it also wasn't working.
                    Me: 	*Shudder* (At least, not in the right way...)
                    Eve:	So, none of your tech was working.
                    Eve:	I still don't get what's so strange about all this.
                    Me: 	It gets weirder.
                    Me: 	I wanted to go downstairs, but the door handle wouldn't budge.
                    Eve:	So, it was locked?
                    Me: 	No, it wasn't stuck like that.
                    Me: 	It was like the door knob was fused solid.
                    Me: 	I couldn't turn it at all.
                    Eve:	Oh. That is pretty weird.
                Me: 	After that, I went to check the window one more time.
                Me: 	Of course, the person was still standing there.
                Eve:	In the same spot?
                Me: 	Yeah. The same exact position, too.
                Eve:	(Wow, that is pretty creepy.)
                Me: 	So, I realized I needed to investigate.
                Me: 	I went to my bedroom door, and it opened.
                Me: 	But, it didn't lead to the upstairs landing.
                Me: 	It brought me directly outside, onto the front porch.
                Eve:	Oh, like some kind of portal?
                Me: 	I guess, but it didn't look magical.
                Me: 	It was more like the threshold was misaligned in time and space.
                Eve:	Very sci-fi. I like it.
                Me: 	Eve, this felt more real to me than some sci-fi book.
                Eve:	Sorry, please continue.
                Me: 	Outside the house I was able to see the eclipse fully.
                Me: 	It had a red corona around it...
                Me: 	It was the source of the red light in the sky.
                Me: 	Below the sky, the person was still standing in the same position.
                Me: 	I got closer and realized it was Stacy.
                Eve:	(Stacy? Why Stacy?)
                Me: 	She ran off when I got closer.
                Me: 	I followed her, because I felt like she was in danger...
                Me: 	But, I lost her deep in the forest.
                Me: 	Then...
                Eve:	Then?
                Me: 	Then I woke up.
                Eve:	That's it?
                Me: 	Yeah, that's all I can remember at this point.
                Eve:	That's not very strange.
                Me: 	I'm sure your dreams are much more interesting.
                Me: 	Things like, where you misplaced your case notes.
                Me: 	Or, when your new batch of patients are arriving.
                Me: 	You really make my life sound boring.
                Me: 	Well, maybe it isn't as boring as I believe...
                Me: 	Anyway, the main feeling I can't shake from the dream is the coincidence.
                Me: 	An eclipse is going to happen a day after I dreamed about one.
                Eve:	You really shouldn't think much of it...
                Eve:	I believe you heard about it somewhere, maybe the internet.
                Eve:	And, your subconscious mind weaved that bit of info into your dream.
                Me: 	Yeah, you're right.
                Me: 	It's probably nothing.
                Me: 	(I just can't shake that feeling, though...)
                Me: 	(I need to figure out how Stacy plays into all of this.)
                Me: 	(I should make sure she's doing okay...)
                Eve:	*Unintelligible*
                noname:	On the day of the Summer Solstice.
                Eve:	Dennis.
                noname:	What a treat!
                Eve:	Dennis!
                Me: 	Shit!
                Me: 	Sorry!
                Me: 	I guess I zoned out a little bit.
                Eve:	Yeah, you did.
                Me: 	I'll clean it up.
        Narr:	You decide it's probably best not to tell Eve about your dream.
        Me: 	Ah, it's nothing.
        Me: 	Just a little bit of deja vu.
        Eve:	Oh, really?
        Me: 	Yeah...
        Me: 	I feel like I knew the eclipse was coming.
        Me: 	Any idea what it means?
        Eve:	Well, it means you may have heard about it somewhere.
        Eve:	And, your subconscious held on to it.
        Me: 	But, the feeling was so strong.
        Eve:	Deja vu usually happens to people when they're under stress.
        Me: 	Hmm...
        Eve:	Oh, come on Dennis...
        Eve:	You don't think I'm asking too much of you, do you?
        Me: 	No, not really.
        Me: 	Maybe it's lingering stress from final exams.
        Eve:	It very well could be.
        Eve:	(Maybe I should give him some time off.)
        Eve:	(He may be working, but it's still his summer break.)
        Me: 	Is there any coffee left in the pot?
        Eve:	Of course.
        Eve:	Feel free to grab some if you'd like.
        Me: 	*Sip* Ah.
        Me: 	Good coffee as usual.
        Eve:	Yeah, I've really learned how to use that machine well.
        Me: 	Mhm.
        noname:	The total solar eclipse will happen tomorrow...
        Eve:	*Unintelligible*
        noname:	On the day of the Summer Solstice.
        Eve:	Dennis.
        noname:	What a treat!
        Eve:	Dennis!
        Me: 	Shit!
        Me: 	Sorry!
        Me: 	I guess I zoned out a little bit.
        Eve:	Yeah, you did.
        Me: 	I'll clean it up.
Me: 	I got it.
Emily:	Morning!
Emily:	Good to see the janitor is on duty so early!
Me: 	Morning, Em.
Emily:	Whose spill are you cleaning up?
Eve:	*Chuckle* His own.
Emily:	Dennis! I thought janitors were supposed to clean messes, not make them.
Me: 	I was just a little distracted by the TV.
Eve:	Emily, he's still in dreamland.
Emily:	*Giggle* Clearly.
Emily:	Want me to get you a refill, Dennis?
Me: 	Thanks, Em. That would be great.
Emily:	Oh! Just promise not to spill it again.
Me: 	*Chuckle* Yeah, yeah. Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice.
Emily:	Be right back!
Eve:	Speaking of which, I'll also excuse myself for a moment.
Kiara:	Hey, you.
Me: 	Hey yourself. Did you sleep well?
Kiara:	Kinda. I had a weird dream.
Emily:	Oh? What was it about?
Kiara:	It's not really important.
Emily:	Oh, come on! You're no fun!
Me: 	Yeah, tell us!
Kiara:	Fine.
Kiara:	So, it was pitch black outside and I was walking in the woods.
Kiara:	It was eerie. I was afraid, but I couldn't pinpoint why.
Kiara:	I had this grim feeling someone, or something, was following me.
Emily:	Ooh. Was it like a serial killer?
Me: 	Or a witch?
Emily:	Oooh...
Emily:	I bet it was some demon, waiting for its chance to corner you and suck your soul out.
Emily:	Take your body and walk around like an evil Kiara.
Emily:	Devoid of all fun and happiness.
Emily:	Maybe it wasn't a dream, after all.
Kiara:	Ugh, never mind! I knew you'd make fun of it!
Me: 	C'mon, Emily was just teasing you. Go on.
Kiara:	Whatever, it's too early for Emily's nonsense.
Emily:	So sensitive.
Emily:	How did you sleep, Dennis?
Emily:	Did you have an exciting dream, too?
Me: 	(Oh, god, did she hear me?)
Me: 	I don't remember what I dreamed of.
Emily:	Hmm... I did hear some noises coming from your room last night.
Kiara:	Really? What kind of noises?
Me: 	I wasn't making any noises. Like I said, I don't remember anything.
Emily:	He had a wet dream about Stacy.
Me: 	What?!
Kiara:	You did?
Me: 	No, I didn't!
Me: 	Stop making things up, Emily!
Emily:	I think Dennis has a thing for Stacy.
Me: 	That's not true!
Emily:	Did you notice, Dennis?
Me: 	Notice what?
Emily:	How Kiara's dream is really familiar.
Kiara:	What are you talking about?
Emily:	Well, you know what they say...
Emily:	That you dream of things from real life, just in a different way than it happened.
Kiara:	So?
Emily:	Sooo...
Me: 	(If Kiara finds out Emily knows about the Forest Sucker...)
Me: 	It doesn't have to mean anything, Em.
Emily:	Yeah, but, it's strange, no?
    Eve:	What's not true?
    Me: 	Oh, nothing. Emily's imagination is running wild.
    Eve:	About what?
    Emily:	Dennis has been dreaming about the patients.
    Me: 	I told you, that's not what happened!
        Eve:	Oh, is this the dream you spoke to me about earlier?
        Me: 	Yeah, it is.
        Emily:	But, Eeeve... We didn't get to hear it, yet.
        Eve:	Oh, I'm sorry. Dennis, you may continue telling them.
        Me: 	Sure thing.
        Me: 	So, I woke up in my room, but everything was off.
        Me: 	Nothing was working like it should have.
        Emily:	Like what?
        Me: 	My phone was off, and the laptop...
        Emily:	Yes?
        Me: 	The laptop, um...
        Me: 	(Think fast, Dennis!)
        Me: 	...had a weird wallpaper.
        Eve:	Why was it weird?
        Me: 	It was of some random girl.
        Kiara:	Was she naked?
        Me: 	Of course not!
        Emily:	I think it was Stacy.
        Me: 	I told you to stop with that!
        Eve:	Why would pictures of Stacy be on your laptop?
        Emily:	Because she was in Dennis's dream last night.
        Eve:	She was?
        Me: 	Yes, I did dream about her, but not in the way Emily is suggesting.
        Emily:	We're all ears, Dennis.
        Me: 	Okay, so, at one point I looked out of the window and the sky was crimson.
        Me: 	There was a silhouette standing outside, but I couldn’t see who it was.
        Kiara:	Why was the sky crimson?
        Me: 	I don’t know. Like I said, everything was weird.
        Eve:	Go on...
        Me: 	I realized it was Stacy, but she didn’t notice me.
        Emily:	Did that make you sad?
        Eve:	Stop teasing him, Emily. Let him finish.
        Me: 	I went after her, but eventually she disappeared.
        Emily:	Where did she disappear?
        Me: 	You know what, I’m done with this interrogation.
        Emily:	Oh, come on, Dennis! We're joking. We really want to know!
        Eve:	I'm sorry, Dennis. I can't speak for Emily, but I'm genuinely interested.
        Me: 	I saw Stacy in my dream. I don’t know why that’s so weird!
        Me: 	I’ve been spending time with them, seeing that I'm staff here.
        Eve:	Of course. No one’s accusing you, Dennis.
        Eve:	Dreams shouldn't always be interpreted literally.
        Eve:	It’s perfectly natural that one of the patients appeared in your dreams.
        Eve:	But, it depends on a lot of different factors, though.
        Me: 	What are you saying?
        Eve:	Nothing, really. It's just a thought.
        Eve:	Dennis, come by my office after breakfast.
        Eve:	I'll need to speak with you.
        Eve:	I’ll see you later guys!
        Me: 	(Shit! Did she figure it out?)
        Me: 	Sure thing. See you soon.
        Emily:	Byeeee!
        Me: 	You don't need to stir the pot, Em.
        Emily:	It’s so boooring here. I’m just having some fun.
        Emily:	It’s not like she believed me.
        Me: 	She could have. Then I’d really be in trouble.
        Emily:	We'd come and save you. Right, Kiara?
        Kiara:	Sure.
        Me: 	How thoughtful of you...
        Me: 	Have fun at someone else's expense next time, okay?
        Emily:	I’ll try my best. But, I’m keeping my eye on you.
        Kiara:	(I am, too.)
        Eve:	Oh, is this the dream you spoke to me about earlier?
        Me: 	Yeah, it is.
        Emily:	But, Eeeve... We didn't get to hear it, yet.
        Eve:	Oh, I'm sorry. Dennis, you may continue telling them.
        Me: 	Sure thing.
        Me: 	So, I woke up in my room, but everything was off.
        Me: 	Nothing was working like it should have.
        Emily:	Like what?
        Me: 	My phone was off, and the laptop...
        Emily:	Yes?
        Me: 	The laptop, um...
        Me: 	(Think fast, Dennis!)
        Me: 	...had a weird wallpaper.
        Emily:	What kind of weird wallpaper?
        Me: 	It was of some random girl.
        Kiara:	Was she naked?
        Me: 	Of course not!
        Emily:	I bet it was Stacy.
        Me: 	I told you to stop with that!
        Kiara:	Why would pictures of Stacy be on Dennis's laptop?
        Eve:	Hmm... Stacy was the main figure in his dream.
        Kiara:	She was?
        Me: 	Yes, I did dream about her, but not in the way you think.
        Emily:	We're all ears, Dennis.
        Me: 	Okay, so, at one point I looked out of the window and the sky was crimson.
        Me: 	There was a silhouette standing outside, but I couldn’t see who it was.
        Kiara:	Why was the sky crimson?
        Me: 	I don’t know. Like I said, everything was weird.
        Eve:	Mhm.
        Me: 	I realized it was Stacy, but she didn’t notice me.
        Emily:	Did that make you sad?
        Eve:	Stop teasing him, Emily. Let him finish.
        Me: 	I went after her, but eventually she disappeared.
        Emily:	Where did she disappear?
        Me: 	You know what, I’m done with this interrogation.
        Emily:	Oh, come on, Dennis! We're joking. We really want to know!
        Eve:	I'm sorry, Dennis.
        Eve:	You'll have to excuse their curiosity about your dream.
        Eve:	And, their assumptions of why Stacy was there...
        Me: 	Yeah, I saw Stacy in my dream.
        Me: 	I don’t know why that’s so weird!
        Me: 	I’ve been spending time with them, seeing that I'm staff here.
        Eve:	Of course. No one’s accusing you of anything, Dennis.
        Eve:	Dreams shouldn't always be interpreted literally.

        Kiara:	Sure.

        Me: 	Have fun at someone else's expense next time, okay?
        Emily:	I’ll try my best. But, I’m keeping my eye on you.
        Kiara:	(I am, too.)
    Eve:	What's strange?
    Emily:	That Kiara is dreaming about a forest.
    Eve:	Why would that be strange?
    Kiara:	I don't know.
    Emily:	Well, because Kiara is dreaming about Dennis’s experience.
    Me: 	It’s not the same. You’ve been watching too many movies, Emily.
    Emily:	I’m actually more into reality shows lately.
    Eve:	What experience are you talking about?
    Kiara:	I was dreaming about being in a forest...
    Kiara:	...and Emily quickly deduced that it’s similar to Dennis’s experience.
    Emily:	Where he got really scared of the fluffy forest critters.
    Me: 	I actually ended up unconscious.
    Kiara:	Maybe we should drop this, Emily. I don’t think Dennis would like to remember it.
    Emily:	Are you sure?
    Eve:	I see... Why is all of this so important?
    Eve:	(What is she getting at?)
    Me: 	It’s not! That’s what I’ve been saying!
    Me: 	People have similar dreams. It’s not so unusual, Emily.
    Eve:	That’s true.
    Eve:	On the other hand, peoples' subconscious can be woven into their narrative.
    Emily:	Yeah. Kiara was really sympathetic to Dennis's experience.
    Eve:	Dennis, come by my office after breakfast.
    Eve:	I'll need to speak with you.
    Me: 	(Shit! Did she figure it out?)
    Me: 	Sure thing. See you soon.
    Eve:	I’ll see you later guys!
    Me: 	Bye, Eve!
    Emily:	Byeeee!
    Me: 	You should have been a comedian, Em.
    Emily:	I know, right?
Emily:	I’m starving. Who’s making breakfast?
Me: 	I vote for Emily.
Emily:	And I vote for Dennis.
Kiara:	I vote for Emily, too.
Emily:	Hey! That's not fair!
Kiara:	Life's not fair. Get used to it.
Emily:	Whatever. I'll do it only because I'm bored...
Me: 	Whatever gets us breakfast sooner...
Me: 	They were talking about an eclipse on TV this morning.
Kiara:	Really? That's weird...
Emily:	What's weird?
Kiara:	That Dennis dreamed of an eclipse a day before one is going to happen.
Emily:	When was the first time you felt your psychic powers developing?
Me: 	What?
Emily:	Can you tell us what will happen today?
Emily:	Or where I'll be living in 5 years?
Kiara:	Probably in a trailer park.
Me: 	I'm not seeing into the future, Em.
Emily:	How can you be sure?
Kiara:	Did you talk to Stacy in the dream?
Me: 	No. I tried calling her name, but she didn't notice.
Me: 	She was just staring into the forest.
Kiara:	How weird.
Emily:	They're all weird.
Me: 	That's not true.
Emily:	Well, you have a crush on them. So...
Emily:	You're kinda biased.
Me: 	I'm trying to get to know them.
Me: 	Because they're human beings, Emily. And they're here to get some help.
Kiara:	How noble of you...
Me: 	Mmm, something smells good.
Emily:	Here you go. Bon appetit!
Me: 	*Laughs* Em!
Kiara:	You're so immature...
Emily:	Don't be such a prude, Kiara!
Emily:	What do you think we'll be doing today?
Me: 	God knows what Eve has planned for me. You two always have it easy.
Kiara:	That's not true! I'm doing all kinds of errands.
Emily:	I'm not. Losers!
Kiara:	That's because Eve doesn't trust you.
Emily:	Either way, I have more free time than both of you, combined.
Me: 	And how do you use it?
Emily:	In all sorts of ways...
Me: 	You sure do...
Me: 	Anyway, see you two later. Eve's expecting me.
Narr:	Having finished your breakfast, you go to Eve's office.
Eve:	Come in!
Eve:	Ah, Dennis!
Me: 	Hey, Eve.
Eve:	Please, sit down.
Eve:	How have the last couple of days been for you?
Me: 	A bit busy.
Eve:	I know I've worked you hard.
Eve:	Which I presume isn't what you had in mind when you came here.
Me: 	Yeah, I didn't imagine myself cleaning the lake at 4 AM.
Eve:	Well, that time it was a punishment.
Eve:	A justified one, I believe.
Me: 	I won't argue with that.
Eve:	What about Kiara and Emily?
Eve:	Have they been treating you right?
Me: 	(Kiara's mouth has certainly been treating me well...)
Me: 	They are alright.
Me: 	Emily has been really energetic and playful.
Me: 	Kiara is as serious as ever.
Eve:	*Chuckles* That sounds about right.
Me: 	And you?
Eve:	Me what?
Me: 	Have you been feeling better?
Eve:	Oh yes, I've started to relax more.
Eve:	I've been really anxious ever since my apprentice left.
Eve:	Seeing you be such a great help has alleviated most of my worries.
Me: 	I'm glad.
Me: 	Smiling suits you better, anyway.
Eve:	Oh, does it?
Me: 	It brings out your eyes.
Eve:	I didn’t realize you noticed these kinds of things.
Me: 	I can be perceptive sometimes.
Eve:	So it seems. That’s quite a nice quality to have.
Eve:	Especially with the ladies.
Me: 	I haven’t practiced it that much, to be honest.
Me: 	(She must have figured it out by now.)
Eve:	Are you sure?
Me: 	(Fuck.)
Me: 	I'm positive.
    Eve:	What do you think of the change in this year’s patients?
    Me: 	You mean the fact that they're all women?
    Eve:	Exactly.
    Eve:	Four charming women must be a lot for you to handle.
    Me: 	*Chuckles* You make it seem like I’ve never been around women before.
    Eve:	Well, you’re young and impressionable.
    Eve:	It wouldn’t be so unusual for you to succumb to their charm.
    Me: 	They are a lot, I have to admit.
    Me: 	But, I'm managing it.
    Eve:	Some of them seem to affect you more than others.
    Me: 	Huh?
    Eve:	The dream...
    Me: 	Oh! I mean, I'm--
    Me: 	It's just that--
    Eve:	Yes?
    Me: 	You know how it is with dreams...
    Me: 	They are a distorted version of reality.
    Eve:	(It’s cute seeing him squirm like this.)
    Eve:	(I still haven’t seen him do anything suspicious, but...)
    Eve:	(I better keep an eye on him.)
    Eve:	Relax, Dennis.
    Eve:	I'm just teasing you.
    Eve:	It's perfectly normal.
    Me: 	It is?
    Eve:	You have been spending time with the patients.
    Eve:	Their experiences have rubbed off on you.
    Eve:	And made their way into your dreams.
    Me: 	They are quite peculiar.
    Me: 	The girls.
    Eve:	They certainly are.
    Eve:	What was all that with Emily and Kiara this morning?
    Me: 	Oh, that was just Emily being silly.
    Me: 	She gets a kick out of teasing Kiara and making her uncomfortable. 
    Eve:	Why does she think Kiara was really sympathetic to your experience?
    Eve:	It seemed to me she was hinting at something.
    Me: 	(Ah, shit! Poker face, Dennis.)
    Me: 	(Poker. Face.)
    Me: 	I honestly have no idea.
    Me: 	God knows what happens in that head of hers.
    Me: 	Emily isn’t the most serious person here.
    Eve:	I must agree with you there.
    Eve:	Maybe some of your maturity rubs off on her.
    Me: 	I seriously doubt it.
Me: 	So, why am I here?
Me: 	More chores to be done today?
Eve:	Actually, no.
Eve:	As I’ve mentioned before, I’d like you to be more involved in the actual therapy.
Me: 	Oh!
Me: 	Are you sure about that?
Me: 	It’s only been a couple of days, and I don’t know the girls that well.
Me: 	(Just play it cool...)
Eve:	You have to start somewhere.
Eve:	So I think this is the best time for that.
Eve:	But, I don’t want to force anything on you if it makes you uncomfortable.
Me: 	(Hmm, spending more time with the girls would certainly be a treat.)
Me: 	(I’d get to know them more.)
Me: 	(I wouldn’t need to resort to eavesdropping so much.)
Me: 	(Plus, it will give me less time to do boring chores.)
Eve:	In general, it would look great on your resume.
Eve:	Impress a professor or two.
Me: 	(Oh, yeah. That’s also a plus.)
Me: 	Of course I’d be interested, Eve.
Me: 	Are you sure about this, though?
Me: 	I’ve only recently started psychology classes, so I don’t have much experience.
Eve:	You’d be supervised at first, of course.
Eve:	Pay attention to their needs, and think about what kind of therapy suits them best.
Eve:	Nothing huge.
Eve:	I’d be there, too, of course. To guide you.
Eve:	Then with time, you’d become more independent.
Eve:	Soon after that, you'd get to guide their individual sessions.
Me: 	(I’ve already started doing something like that.)
Me: 	This all sounds good to me.
Me: 	Thank you for including me in your work.
Me: 	I have so much to learn, and I couldn’t get a better teacher than yourself.
Eve:	Aww, you’re really sweet, Dennis.
Eve:	I do love teaching.
Eve:	Anyway, I’ll have the notes prepared for you.
Eve:	Swing by my office a bit later so we can go over them. 
Me: 	(Sweet!)
Me: 	Great! I'm excited!
Me: 	See you later, Eve!
Eve:	Bye, Dennis!
Stacy:	I can't...
Stacy:	Where are you going?
Belle:	Hmm?
Stacy:	Like a phantom in the darkness...
Belle:	Stacy? Hello?
Belle:	(Is she communing with the spirits?)
Stacy:	The Charred Kings have their ways...
Belle:	Stacy? Wake up.
Stacy:	What?
Belle:	That lord of yours. What's it called?
Stacy:	The Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus.
Belle:	Yeah, that weirdo.
Stacy:	It's not a weirdo... It's my guide through these difficult times.
Belle:	Umm, okay...
Belle:	It seemed like you were arguing with someone so...
Stacy:	I don't remember anything...
Belle:	I've seen the movies. What if it possesses my body one night?
Stacy:	It's not a demon, Belle. 
Stacy:	Besides, I don't think a demon would stick with you for long.
Belle:	Why not?
Stacy:	Your toys would frighten him away.
Belle:	*Chuckles* Especially Mr. Long Daddy.
Stacy:	Oh, god. TMI.
Belle:	Stop being such a prude!
Stacy:	I'm not. But, I'm not obsessed with sex like you are, either.
Belle:	Well, do what you do best. 
Belle:	Wasn't that a famous quote?
Stacy:	From who?
Belle:	I dunno.
Belle:	Someone.
Belle:	I thought you knew who.
Belle:	Since you mentioned it...
Belle:	I'm always in the mood for some morning exercise.
Stacy:	I'm not in the mood, Belle.
Belle:	Because of Lord Albatros?
Stacy:	I told you, it's not...
Stacy:	Ugh, never mind. Thank you, but I'll pass.
Belle:	Fine. Your loss.
Belle:	Anyway, can I ask you something?
Stacy:	It's still too early, Belle. Can't it wait?
Belle:	No.
Belle:	Is this working for you?
Stacy:	What? Sharing the cabin with you?
Belle:	No, silly. The therapy, I mean. The sessions we're having.
Stacy:	I haven't really put much thought into it. 
Stacy:	Sure, it's helpful. Don't you think?
Belle:	Ehh. I'm not sure why I'm here. So I don't see the point in it.
Stacy:	Well, I'm sure Dr. Eve would disagree.
Belle:	I think Dr. Eve can be persuaded.
Stacy:	See, that's the problem.
Belle:	Huh?
Stacy:	You turn everything into sexual talk.
Belle:	That's not true!
Belle:	*Chuckles* Okay, it's a bit true.
Belle:	You're all so uptight about it. I don't see why it's such a big deal.
Stacy:	C'mon Belle. You know what I'm talking about.
Stacy:	You act clueless so nobody asks you more questions.
Stacy:	I don't want to poke the bear. I'm here if you want to talk about it.
Belle:	There's nothing to talk about.
Stacy:	Fine. I'm just saying.
Belle:	But thank you. Same goes for you.
Belle:	If you and Lord Phoenix are having marital problems, I'm great at giving advice.
Stacy:	Our community is great at accepting people who are struggling to find their way in life.
Stacy:	You should consider joining us.
Belle:	Are there any hot men there?
Stacy:	I give up. 
Stacy:	It's too early in the morning. I'd like to get some more sleep.
Belle:	Agreed.
Eve:	Right. We're nearly there.
Eve:	I hope the girls got a good night's sleep.
Emily:	I'm sure they did.
Emily:	Unlike Dennis.
Me: 	I'm starting to think I won't get a good night's sleep here.
Emily:	Maybe Kiara and I put rocks in your mattress?
Eve:	*Chuckle* Emily, did you two really do that?
Emily:	*Giggle* I'll never tell.
Me: 	Are you sure Emily wouldn't, Eve?
Eve:	Hmm...
Eve:	No. I don't think Emily would really do that.
Eve:	She would rather just make you believe she did.
Eve:	Anyway...
Eve:	Let's get back to business, people.
Eve:	Good moooorning!
Eve:	Ladies, please make your way outside!
Belle:	Hey, handsome.
Me: 	Good morning, Belle.
Eve:	Let's keep things professional with staff, please.
Belle:	*Giggle* Sorry Dr. Eve.
Belle:	It's a force of habit.
Violet:	Good morning.
Me: 	(Stacy's here, and she looks fine.)
Me: 	(But... She looks as tired as I feel this morning.)
Me: 	(I wonder what she's been up to...)
Eve:	Please, listen up, ladies.
Eve:	Today, your therapies will be unified.
Naomi:	Unified?
Eve:	Yes.
Eve:	Today, you'll all be participating in group therapy.
Eve:	The first group session of the day will be more light-hearted.
Eve:	It will be a good baseline session.
Eve:	The topic is your opinions of each other.
Eve:	You've all had some time to get acclimated with each other.
Eve:	So, the results should be more accurate than the day you all arrived.
Eve:	Following this session, later in the day, you'll discuss your opinions...
Eve:	Of yourselves.
Me: 	(That might give me some insight into the girls' minds.)
Eve:	That's really all to it.
Eve:	You all have some free time before your first session begins.
Eve:	After the session we'll break to prepare lunch.
Eve:	As usual.
Eve:	Anyway, I think that covers it.
Eve:	Thank you for your cooperation, ladies.
Eve:	We'll see you all very soon.
Eve:	Dennis, you also have some free time.
Eve:	You should spend it wisely.
Emily:	Like waking up fully.
Me: 	*Chuckle* I'm awake now!
Eve:	That's good to hear.
Eve:	We'll need that focus later today.
Me: 	Sure, Eve.
Me: 	I'm ready for whatever tasks you have for me.
Eve:	Oh, don't worry. I won't go overboard.
Me: 	Thanks, Eve.
        Narr:	Where should Dennis go?
                Narr:	Which Cabin would you like to check
    Me: 	(I wonder what Naomi and Violet have been up to.)
    Me: 	(Hopefully not bitching at each other.)
    Me: 	(Maybe therapy's helped them to at least hate each other less...)
    Me: 	(It's better to take a peek from the window just in case.)
    Me: 	(Oh?)
    Me: 	(Nobody's home?)
    Me: 	(I wonder where Violet is. Probably doing yoga at the dock.)
    Me: 	(And, Naomi is... Somewhere.)
            Narr:	Where should Dennis go?
    Me: 	(Couldn't hurt to see what Belle and Stacy are doing...)
    Narr:	Just as you're about to knock, Belle opens the door.
    Belle:	Hey handsome, looking for me?
    Me: 	Umm, not really.
    Me: 	Just walking around and thought I'd check up on you and Stacy.
    Me: 	See how you're doing.
    Belle:	I don't know where Stacy went, but I'm free for whatever.
    Belle:	And I need your help.
    Me: 	Oh? What with?
    Belle:	Sit there.
    Me: 	(Uhmm, is this what I think it is?)
    Belle:	Can you take this off? I'm having trouble unhooking it.
    Me: 	Belle, I really shouldn't. What if someone comes in?
    Belle:	We'll tell them it's a medical problem.
    Me: 	What medical problem?
    Belle:	Stop asking so many questions and just unhook it.
    Narr:	Not that you have a problem with undressing women, but if someone comes in and sees you holding Belle's bra...
    Narr:	That wouldn't look good.
    Narr:	Seeing Belle's perfectly shaped breasts stuns you for a moment and you just stare at them.
    Belle:	From your look, I'd say you like what you see.
    Me: 	Well...
    Me: 	Who wouldn't?
    Belle:	But like I said, I need your advice.
    Belle:	So you need to take this seriously.
    Me: 	(Is she serious?)
    Me: 	Of course.
    Belle:	Hands in front.
    Narr:	You're still not sure what game Belle is playing, but you happily oblige her request.
    Belle:	This isn't foreplay, you know.
    Me: 	Oh, come on. What are we doing, then?
    Belle:	I need you to feel my breasts for any irregularities.
    Me: 	What?
    Belle:	You know, sometimes women need to get checked by someone else.
    Belle:	Just to make sure...
    Me: 	I’ll make sure to be thorough.
    Belle:	You need to feel around them. Touch them. Squeeze them.
    Belle:	Mmm, just like that...
    Belle:	Slowly and thoroughly...
    Belle:	Your hands feel so warm. Mmmm, go on...
    Narr:	Hearing her moan starts to excite you.
    Me: 	I don't feel anything.
    Belle:	Are you sure?
    Belle:	You feel something.
    Belle:	Is this turning you on, Dennis?
    Me: 	Feeling you up? You know it is...
    Belle:	Thank you, Dennis. I just wanted to make sure everything is okay.
    Belle:	You've been a great help.
    Me: 	Sure, anytime.
    Me: 	(She's just fucking with me.)
    Belle:	In that case, we can finish what we started a bit later.
    Belle:	I need to take care of some things, so you can swing by another time.
    Me: 	(What the hell does she need taking care of now?)
    Me: 	Deal. Don't be too long.
    Belle:	I wouldn't dream.
    Me: 	(I should wait for my hard-on to go away before I walk around camp some more...)
    Me: 	(I haven't been in Cabin 3 since Kiara and I cleaned it.)
    Me: 	Ah. (That was the day I arrived here.)
    Me: 	(I wonder if anyone has been in here since then.)
    Me: 	(Might as well check it out.)
    Me: 	(The girls are doing their own thing and Eve is somewhere around the house.)
    Me: 	(I can go see what the girls are doing afterwards.)
    Narr:	After carefully opening the door, you see that Cabin 3 is completely empty.
    Me: 	(Hmm... Why is the bed unmade?)
    Me: 	(Nobody should be sleeping in this cabin.)
    Me: 	(Who would use this room?)
    Me: 	(It's locked. Interesting. I'll need to find a key.)
    Me: 	(Must be somewhere around here.)
    Me: 	Bingo! Let's see what's in this Pandora's Box.
    Me: 	(Damn! So, Eve's really into hardcore shit.)
    Me: 	(I guess I found out who uses this cabin...)
    Me: 	(This is really kinky.)
    Me: 	(How do you even use this? I bet Belle would know.)
    Narr:	Images of fucking Belle tied up with this flood your mind.
    Me: 	(She'd love this. Maybe Eve wouldn't notice if I borrow this some time.)
    Me: 	(I'll return the key. Hopefully they'll leave it here.)
    Me: 	(Photographs?)
    Me: 	(This is... Wow...)
    Narr:	You're taken aback by Eve's secret side.
    Narr:	You've always admired her maturity and graciousness.
    Narr:	Not that you didn't notice her sex appeal...
    Narr:	But, you've never imagined she'd be into this type of stuff.
    Me: 	(What a pleasant surprise...)
    Me: 	(Just some pencils...)
    Me: 	(Wait, what's this?)
    Me: 	(A key? Does it open something in here?)
        Me: 	(It's for the closet!)
    Me: 	(Just a regular bin. Nothing important here.)
    Me: 	(Just a regular pillow...)
    Me: 	(Hmm...)
    Me: 	("Pretzel Dip. Spork. The Om. Magic Mountain.")
    Me: 	(What the hell is this? Some code?)
    Me: 	(Code for what? I'll have to look it up.)
    Narr:	Not wanting someone to notice you snooping around here, you put everything in its place.
    Me: 	(So many books. Seems like such a waste.)
    Me: 	(Doubt any of the girls seems interested in spending their time here reading.)
    Me: 	(What's this?)
    Me: 	(Oooh! Kama Sutra!)
    Me: 	(She's into the interesting shit, huh?)
    Me: 	(She certainly is creative.)
    Me: 	(If only I had a photographic memory...)
    Me: 	(Whose backpack is this?)
    Me: 	(Lingerie?)
    Me: 	(Ugh, that's probably Eve's. I should put it back.)
    Me: 	(I should get out of here.)
    Me: 	(It's unlikely I'll find anything that will answer my questions in here.)
    Me: 	(In all honesty, this just creates more questions...)
    Me: 	(Better leave it for another time.)
    Me: 	(I have been hanging around the girls a lot.) 
    Me: 	(People started to notice it.)
    Me: 	(But that's my job! Why would I need to justify that?)
    Me: 	(Well, I have been ignoring The Guidelines...)
    Me: 	(Eve's been riding my ass ever since I've arrived here...)
    Narr:	Realizing it's better to hang around the house, at least for now, you make your way towards the patio.
    Me: 	(Basking in the sun could be relaxing...)
    Me: 	(Steer my mind away from hot girls.)
    Me: 	(No one is here. Ah, sweet solitude.)
    Narr:	A lot of things have happened so far.
    Narr:	Your mind is sizzling with all the information you've gathered.
    Narr:	Getting to know the girls was fun, but sneaking around behind Eve's back has been a bit stressful.
    Me: 	(I hope the rest of the summer goes more smoothly.)
    Me: 	(I wonder why I dreamed of the eclipse?)
    Me: 	(It was strangely coincidental...)
    Me: 	(Hmm...)
    Me: 	(Maybe I do have secret powers?)
    Me: 	(Naah, Emily is just messing with my head.)
    Me: 	(What the--)
    Kiara:	There you are! I've been looking for you.
    Me: 	You have?
    Kiara:	Yeah, you're always running around.
    Me: 	Well, looks like it's your lucky day.
    Kiara:	Absolutely.
    Kiara:	How have you been feeling? You seem kinda off.
        Kiara:	How have you been feeling? You seem kinda off.
            Kiara:	Because of Stacy?
                Kiara:	Because of Stacy?
                    Kiara:	Why do you care so much about her?
                        Kiara:	Why do you care so much about her?
                            Me: 	And why are you so annoyed with me dreaming about Stacy?
                            Me: 	I would care about anyone who seems bothered by something. Including you.
                    Me: 	Not really. It was more because of the confusion I felt in the dream.
                    Kiara:	I know. I felt the same.
                    Me: 	It's weird how something we know isn't real makes us so upset.
            Me: 	It's been a long couple of days. The patients, the chores...
            Kiara:	You're feeling overwhelmed because of the patients or the chores?
                Kiara:	You're feeling overwhelmed because of the patients or the chores?
                    Me: 	Yeah, I feel kinda responsible for them in a way.
                    Kiara:	And what about our feelings?
                    Me: 	What do you mean?
                    Kiara:	It seems like you're awfully preoccupied with them. I feel left out.
                        Kiara:	It seems like you're awfully preoccupied with them. I feel left out.
                            Me: 	I'm sorry you feel like that. You know you mean a lot to me.
                    Me: 	It's the chores. I feel like Eve is making it harder for me on purpose.
                    Kiara:	Well, it's not like you're the only one doing chores around here.
                        Kiara:	Well, it's not like you're the only one doing chores around here.
                            Me: 	Well, you don't have to scrub decks and nail planks on roofs, do you?
                            Me: 	I know you're helping, too. I'm just tired of these physical chores. I feel like a maid.
    Kiara:	I knew it was going to be like this.
    Me: 	Like what? Me actually doing my job?
    Kiara:	Oh, you're trying way too hard this summer.
    Kiara:	I wonder why...
    Me: 	What are you implying?
    Me: 	That I want to sleep with them?
    Kiara:	You said it, not me.
    Me: 	Spill it, then. Looks like it's been on your mind for some time.
    Kiara:	Yeah, I think you just want to get in their pants.
    Kiara:	And that's the sole reason you're trying so hard.
    Kiara:	Did you really think I wouldn't notice you ogling them?
    Me: 	You're imagining things.
    Me: 	Yes, they're all pretty. But that doesn't mean I want to fuck them.
    Me: 	When there were male patients here, you didn't complain.
    Me: 	If my memory serves me correctly... You loved their attention.
    Kiara:	So what? Since when is it a crime to get an ego boost?
    Me: 	It's not. So why are you harassing me about it?
    Kiara:	I thought you cared about them. That it wasn't about your ego.
    Kiara:	That you're so worried about their feelings.
    Me: 	It's not about my ego! Stop twisting my words.
    Me: 	If you're just jealous that I'm not giving you enough attention, then say so.
    Kiara:	Fine. I'm jealous. Okay?
    Kiara:	Is that what you wanted to hear?
    Kiara:	I just wanted to hang out with you, because I feel left out.
    Me: 	Kiara, they are other ways to express how you feel.
    Me: 	You don't need to get so angry. 
    Me: 	Or tie me up in the forest to get what you want.
    Kiara:	Are we really doing this again?! 
    Kiara:	I told you I'm sorry!
    Kiara:	How many times do I have to say it?
    Me: 	Keep your voice down! Do you want Eve to hear any of this?
    Me: 	We would be thrown out of camp by the end of the day.
    Me: 	Will you please sit down?
    Kiara:	No, I will not!
    Me: 	(So much for my relaxation...)
    Narr:	You're feeling a bit frustrated. Pleasing everyone seems impossible...
    Narr:	And, you're getting caught up in everything that's going around you.
    Me: 	(Maybe I should have gone camping with Jane...)
    Me: 	(On the other hand, I wouldn't have hung out with so many beautiful women.)
    Me: 	(Which isn't so bad...)
    Me: 	(No time like summer to have fun and explore a bit, right?)
    Narr:	Trying to forget about Kiara's attitude, you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and...
    Narr:	...go back to your zen state.
    Kiara:	We're in the same boat, aren't we?
    Me: 	Yeah. Lucky us.
    Kiara:	Come on, it's not that bad, is it?
    Me: 	Well, no. I get to hang around you and Emily.
    Me: 	I kinda missed you guys.
    Kiara:	Kinda?
    Me: 	Okay, I kinda missed you a lot. How's that?
    Kiara:	You passed. Barely.
    Kiara:	Do you think therapy will work for these girls?
    Me: 	I'm not sure. Hopefully it will. 
    Me: 	I mean, they're good people. 
    Me: 	They just...
    Kiara:	...need some guidance.
    Me: 	Exactly. Though some need more therapy than others.
    Kiara:	*Chuckles* Who do you think will go home first?
    Me: 	Hmm. Violet?
    Kiara:	You think?
    Me: 	She seems the most normal of them all. 
    Me: 	Plus, she seems genuinely interested in getting help.
    Kiara:	Or Naomi. Even though she's a posh snob.
    Me: 	*Laughs* That's for sure. 
    Me: 	At times, she seems too preoccupied with her beauty.
    Kiara:	I know who'll have to stay the longest.
    Me: 	Belle?
    Kiara:	Bingo!
    Me: 	She's not that bad.
    Kiara:	Just a sexual maniac.
    Me: 	A bit. Why do you think that is?
    Kiara:	Who knows. It could be that her libido is insatiable.
    Kiara:	Or someone hurt her.
    Me: 	And that's why she's so obsessed with sex?
    Kiara:	Ahh, Dennis. There's a lot you don't understand about women.
    Kiara:	It's about taking control.
    Me: 	Huh.
    Kiara:	By the way, don't fret about Eve so much.
    Kiara:	I really don't think she's giving you more work because she hates you.
    Me: 	I know, but at times it seems like that.
    Kiara:	It's not like I particularly enjoy running around the camp.
    Me: 	Yeah, but you chose to come back this summer.
    Me: 	I didn't.
    Kiara:	Just try to make the best of it.
    Me: 	Yeah, I'll try.
    Kiara:	Do you miss college? And Jane?
    Me: 	Yes, and no.
    Me: 	It's been an adjustment, but I think we've made a good decision regarding our relationship.
    Kiara:	I couldn't agree more.
    Me: 	You just wanted Jane out of the way.
    Kiara:	I have no idea what you're talking about.
    Me: 	I totally believe you.
    Kiara:	I do fancy spending more time with you.
    Me: 	Summer's just started. We'll have plenty of time to catch up.
    Kiara:	Talking's just one part of it. 
    Kiara:	I mean something else... Something more.
    Me: 	Oh?
    Narr:	Do you want Kiara to continue?
        Narr:	Do you want Kiara to continue?
            Me: 	Kiara, someone might see us!
            Kiara:	Not if we're quick enough.
            Narr:	You let go for a moment and enjoy Kiara's touch.
            Me: 	That actually feels nice.
            Kiara:	I know...
            Kiara:	I want to do so much more than this.
            Me: 	Mmm. You know I couldn't say no.
            Narr:	Kiara's touch makes you hard instantly.
            Me: 	If Eve...
            Kiara:	Shh. Just enjoy the moment.
            Me: 	Mmm. Fuck!
            Narr:	Your dick awakens from her touch, and you decide to pull her mouth closer to your cock.
            Me: 	Don't stop. Your mouth feels amazing.
            Narr:	Kiara continues pleasuring you as you try to stifle your moans.
            Narr:	She sensually massages your dick inside her mouth. 
            Me: 	It won't take long for me to cum if you continue like this.
            Kiara:	Mmmffm.
            Kiara:	I'd love if you would cum into my mouth again.
            Narr:	Kiara sloooowly licks your shaft up and down...
            Narr:	...and tastes your tip...
            Me: 	Uhh... Mmm...
            Narr:	Until you can't take it anymore...
            Me: 	I'm gonna cum.
            Kiara:	Cum all over my mouth.
            Me: 	Mmph!
            Me: 	This was... just perfect.
            Kiara:	Yeah? I have some more ideas...
            Me: 	Do tell.
            Kiara:	Some other time. 
            Kiara:	Let your imagination run wild with it. 
            Kiara:	I have to go now. I'll find you later.
            Kiara:	You should clean up the evidence.
            Narr:	You're trying to find the words, 
            Narr:	but the image of Kiara sucking you off is imprinted into your brain...
            Narr:	Stopping all other brain activities currently in progress.
            Me: 	(Down, boy.)
            Me: 	Kiara, someone might see us!
            Kiara:	Not if we're quick enough.
            Me: 	No, it's too dangerous!
            Kiara:	Since when have you become so dull?
            Me: 	Well, I have my reasons not to have sex right in front of Eve.
            Me: 	I thought you'd get that.
            Kiara:	I do, but...
            Me: 	But what?
            Kiara:	I just wanted to have some fun.
            Me: 	Can we try a bit later?
            Kiara:	Sure!
            Kiara:	Don't keep me waiting. Later then!
            Me: 	Bye!
            Me: 	(No time like summer to have fun and explore a bit, right?)
            Narr:	Trying to forget about the dangers of being caught, you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and...
            Narr:	...go back to your zen state.
    Me: 	Hey, Violet.
    Violet:	Hi, Dennis.
    Violet:	You came to join me in my morning yoga?
    Me: 	Yeah.
    Me: 	I decided to finally take you up on your offer.
    Violet:	That's wonderful, Dennis.
    Violet:	We'll keep it an easy session.
    Violet:	None of the advanced poses.
    Me: 	Oh, you think I can't handle it?
    Violet:	Hey! I didn't say that.
    Violet:	I bet you could handle them.
    Violet:	But, pushing your body too far can result in injury.
    Me: 	I'll take that into consideration, Violet.
    Me: 	(So... Advanced techniques?)
    Me: 	(It might impress Violet to speak "her language.")
    Me: 	(I could also just take it easy.)
    Me: 	(Hmm...)
        Me: 	(Hmm...)
            Me: 	I think we can take it easy.
            Violet:	Okay, Dennis. We can do some beginner poses.
            Me: 	Great! That's better, since I'm still shaking off sleep.
            Violet:	Oh, you didn't sleep well?
            Me: 	Not really...
            Me: 	I had a strange dream last night.
            Violet:	What was it about?
            Violet:	Woah, that's pretty creepy...
            Violet:	And, you're sure it was Stacy?
            Me: 	Yeah, I'm certain it was.
            Violet:	Very weird...
            Me: 	Violet, can I ask you something?
            Violet:	Sure, Dennis. What's on your mind?
                Violet:	Sure, Dennis. What's on your mind?
                    Violet:	Stacy? Well... No, not really.
                        Violet:	Stacy? Well... No, not really.
                            Me: 	Hmm... Okay. Did you notice anything odd around camp last night?
                            Violet:	Yeah. She seemed totally fine to me.
                                Violet:	Yeah. She seemed totally fine to me.
                                    Violet:	I'm doing great, Dennis. Thanks for asking.
                                        Violet:	I'm doing great, Dennis. Thanks for asking.
                    Violet:	Actually, yeah. It's really nice out here.
                        Violet:	Actually, yeah. It's really nice out here.
                            Me: 	I'm happy to hear that. You seem more relaxed than when you arrived.
                            Me: 	Have you seen anything nice on your nighttime walks?
                            Violet:	Yeah, the walks are amazing to calm me down before sleep.
                                Violet:	Yeah, the walks are amazing to calm me down before sleep.
                                    Me: 	That night air sure is something. Which do you like more, morning yoga or the walks?
                                    Me: 	Did you happen to see anything on your walk last night?
            Me: 	I think I can handle the advanced poses.
            Me: 	Let's do this!
            Violet:	If you say so, Dennis.
            Violet:	We'll start with this pose.
            Violet:	It'll warm your muscles up for the next poses.
            Me: 	This is easy, Violet.
            Violet:	Great job! Let's move on to the king dancer pose, then.
            Me: 	This one also looks easy.
            Violet:	It's a bit tougher than it looks.
            Me: 	*Wheeze* That was a piece of cake.
            Me: 	(I think I pulled something.)
            Violet:	Are you okay?
            Me: 	Of course!
            Violet:	Are you sure? You winced when you pulled your leg.
            Me: 	Yeah, yeah. My leg was just a little stiff.
            Me: 	Nothing to worry about.
            Violet:	Hold the leg just a little longer.
            Violet:	And, release.
            Violet:	Since you're doing so well...
            Violet:	I think we can take it up a notch.
            Me: 	(Spine, brace yourself!)
            Narr:	Your spine could never expect what was to come a moment later.
            Violet:	Next is the two-legged inverted staff pose.
            Me: 	The two-legged what now?
            Violet:	The name doesn't matter. Just watch my body.
            Violet:	See how my back is arched, and my arms are supporting most of the weight?
            Me: 	Uhh... Yeah.
            Violet:	It's easy, Dennis. You got this.
            Me: 	Of course. Yeah, I got this.
            Narr:	To your surprise, but nobody else's, you do not have this.
            Me: 	Ah! Shit!
            Violet:	Dennis! Are you okay?
            Me: 	I twisted my neck like in The Exorcist...
            Me: 	Ouch.
            Violet:	Come here, Dennis.
            Violet:	You need to relax the muscles you pulled in your neck.
            Me: 	It's oka--
            Me: 	Wow...
            Me: 	That feels amazing.
            Violet:	Mhm.
            Violet:	I've learned some great massage techniques over the years.
            Violet:	It's a necessity for someone with my lifestyle.
            Me: 	You've got magic hands, Violet.
            Violet:	Thank you, Dennis.
            Me: 	No, no. Thank you.
            Me: 	People would pay hundreds for a massage like this.
            Violet:	You think so?
            Me: 	Yeah.
            Me: 	This is so relaxing I could...
            Violet:	Dennis?
            Violet:	Dennis!
            Me: 	What?
            Violet:	Did you just fall asleep?
            Me: 	Nah, I was just resting my eyes for a second.
            Violet:	So, you didn't sleep well last night?
            Me: 	Not really...
            Me: 	I had a strange dream last night.
            Violet:	What was it about?
            Violet:	Woah, that's pretty creepy...
            Violet:	And, you're sure it was Stacy?
            Me: 	Yeah, I'm certain it was.
            Violet:	Very weird...
            Me: 	Violet, can I ask you something?
            Violet:	Sure, Dennis. What is it?
                Violet:	Sure, Dennis. What is it?
                    Violet:	Stacy? Well, no. Not really.
                        Violet:	Stacy? Well, no. Not really.
                            Me: 	Okay. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary around camp last night?
                            Violet:	Yeah, she seemed totally fine to me.
                                Violet:	Yeah, she seemed totally fine to me.
                                    Me: 	That's good. How are you doing this morning?
                                    Violet:	I'm doing great, Dennis. Thanks for asking.
                                        Violet:	I'm doing great, Dennis. Thanks for asking.
                    Violet:	Yeah, I actually have. It's really nice out here in nature.
                        Violet:	Yeah, I actually have. It's really nice out here in nature.
                            Me: 	Happy to hear it. You do seem more relaxed than day one.
                            Me: 	Have you seen anything nice on your nighttime walks?
                            Violet:	I've seen a lot of shooting stars. So, I feel pretty lucky to be out here.
                                Violet:	I've seen a lot of shooting stars. So, I feel pretty lucky to be out here.
                                    Me: 	Wow, that's great. So, are you more into morning yoga or the nighttime walks?
        Violet:	After you and I went our separate ways, I did take a little walk.
        Violet:	Come to think of it...
    Violet:	It was pretty serene that late at night.
    Violet:	I couldn't even hear the crickets anymore.
    Violet:	When I returned from my walk I heard someone shuffling around.
    Me: 	Walking around where?
    Violet:	I don't know, I couldn't tell where the sound was coming from.
    Violet:	But, I think it was coming from inside the other cabin.
    Me: 	Belle and Stacy's cabin?
    Violet:	Yeah...
    Violet:	At least, it sounded like it came from that direction.
    Violet:	Oh!
    Me: 	Oh?
    Violet:	Yeah, I just remembered something.
    Violet:	As I was falling asleep, I heard what sounded like their cabin door opening.
    Me: 	So, someone left their cabin last night?
    Violet:	I think it's a possibility.
    Me: 	(It could have been Belle...)
    Me: 	(On the prowl for some stimulation.)
    Me: 	(Or, Stacy--)
    Violet:	Anyway, it's been really nice, Dennis.
    Violet:	I know yoga isn't that thrilling.
    Violet:	So, thanks for following through.
    Me: 	Violet, you don't need to thank me.
    Me: 	I really enjoyed it.
        Me: 	And, I wouldn't have gotten the chance to experience your golden hands.
        Violet:	Well, they're available anytime.
        Me: 	Another offer I'll have to take you up on?
        Violet:	That's for you to decide.
    Violet:	Right now, I'm dripping with sweat.
    Violet:	I should really go freshen up, Dennis.
    Violet:	See you later.
    Me: 	See ya, Violet.
    Violet:	Hmm...
    Violet:	Now that you mention it, I do feel more relaxed.
    Violet:	*Sigh* I think being out here is good for me.
    Me: 	It looks like Dr. Eve is doing a great job.
    Violet:	I'd have to agree with you there.
    Violet:	I think what she's doing here is really selfless.
    Me: 	I'll be sure to tell her. I'm sure it'll make her day.
    Me: 	I'm just glad to see you finally out of your shell.
    Violet:	Oh, Dennis. You're too sweet...
    Me: 	You are too. You're the sweetest girl at camp.
    Violet:	Oh, stop it. You're making me blush.
    Me: 	*Chuckle* I can't help it.
    Violet:	Anyway... it's been really nice, Dennis.
    Violet:	I know yoga isn't that thrilling.
    Violet:	So, thanks for following through.
    Me: 	Violet, you don't need to thank me.
    Me: 	I really enjoyed it.
        Me: 	And, I wouldn't have gotten the chance to experience your golden hands.
        Violet:	Well, they're available anytime.
        Me: 	Another offer I'll have to take you up on?
        Violet:	That's for you to decide.
    Violet:	Right now, I'm dripping with sweat.
    Violet:	So, I should really go freshen up.
    Violet:	See you later, Dennis!
    Me: 	See ya, Violet.
    Violet:	Well, yoga helps my body release tension.
    Violet:	It helps me balance my mind and emotions.
    Violet:	And, I think it's pretty healthy in general.
    Me: 	How long have you been doing yoga, Violet?
    Violet:	Hmm...
    Violet:	I'd say around 10 years, now.
    Me: 	*Chuckle* So, do you think you could call yourself a yogi by now?
    Violet:	Oh, no.
    Violet:	I'd need to fully dedicate my life to it.
    Violet:	At this point I'd rather focus on becoming an athlete again.
    Violet:	But, maybe someday I could open a yoga studio.
    Me: 	I think you'll crush it if you do.
    Violet:	Thanks, Dennis.
    Violet:	Maybe I'll invite you to the grand opening some day.
    Violet:	Anyway... It's been really nice, Dennis.
    Violet:	I know yoga isn't that thrilling.
    Violet:	So, thanks for following through.
    Me: 	Violet, you don't need to thank me.
    Me: 	I really enjoyed it.
        Me: 	And, I wouldn't have gotten the chance to experience your golden hands.
        Violet:	Well, they're available anytime.
        Me: 	Another offer I'll have to take you up on?
        Violet:	That's for you to decide.
    Violet:	Right now, I'm dripping with sweat.
    Violet:	So, I should really go freshen up.
    Violet:	See you later, Dennis!
    Me: 	See ya, Violet.
        Me: 	(It's a nice day out. I still have a couple of hours left.)
        Narr:	You don't want to disrupt this meditative flow.
        Narr:	You're enjoying yourself as you sit on the outdoor sofa.
        Narr:	However, you'd like to kick back and relax a bit...
        Narr:	...considering it's going to be a busy day again, soon.
        Me: 	(Let's check what the others are doing.)
        Me: 	(It's a nice day out. I still have a couple of hours left.)
        Narr:	Hanging out with the girls has been fun, but you have a big day ahead of you.
        Narr:	Some peace and quiet might not be so bad.
        Me: 	(Let's check what the others are doing.)
        Narr:	Where should Dennis go?
                Narr:	From which side should Dennis enter house?
        Narr:	Hanging out with the girls has been fun, but you have a big day ahead of you.
        Narr:	Some peace and quiet might not be so bad.
        Me: 	(No place at camp is as relaxing as the house...)
        Me: 	(I should go inside. It's certainly less hot in there.)
    Me: 	(I wonder where everyone is...)
    Me: 	(Even better. I guess I have some time for myself.)
    Me: 	(That's a pretty nice library...)
    Me: 	(What's this?)
    Me: 	"How to cope with the loss of loved ones."
    Me: 	"Dr. Eve Daniels."
    Me: 	(I didn't know she wrote a book...)
    Me: 	"Let yourself feel the pain, and embrace all the other emotions, too."
    Me: 	"Don’t tell yourself how to feel or let others tell you how you should feel."
    Me: 	"When you feel ready, do something creative. Some options include:"
    Me: 	"Write a letter to the person who passed to say everything you wish you could say to them."
    Me: 	"Start keeping a journal. Make a scrapbook. Paint pictures."
    Me: 	"Plant flowers or trees."
    Me: 	(I certainly have no interest in gardening, but these other things seem great.)
    Me: 	(Someone's been reading it, too, it seems.)
    Me: 	(This actually sounds useful. I should give it a deeper read sometime later.)
    Me: 	(I love paintings depicting nature.)
    Me: 	("Eve.")
    Me: 	(Woah! Eve painted this?!)
    Me: 	(I didn't know she's interested in art. Or this good at it.)
    Me: 	(I'll have to ask her about it.)
    Me: 	(It looks like a town square.)
    Me: 	(It was probably some trip Eve took.)
    Me: 	(Someone's been watching porn in the living room?)
    Me: 	(Damn! That's hardcore.)
    Me: 	(I doubt Eve left this on. Which leaves...)
    Emily:	Watching porn here? How dirty of you, Dennis.
    Me: 	Jesus, Em!
    Me: 	This isn't what it looks like!
    Emily:	It looks like you were watching porn.
    Me: 	I was, but...
    Emily:	I didn't know you were into bondage.
    Me: 	I'm not! It was open when I got here!
    Me: 	I was actually wondering who left this here, on...
    Emily:	You?
    Me: 	I told you it wasn't me!
    Me: 	Maybe it was you!
    Emily:	Why would I be watching hardcore porn?
    Emily:	Are you saying I'm into this kinky stuff?
    Me: 	(Oh, god, this conversation is going in the wrong direction...)
    Me: 	Em, I...
    Emily:	Relax, I'm just messing with you.
    Emily:	Eve wants you to meet her at the cabins in 15 minutes.
    Me: 	Oh, okay.
    Emily:	I'll get rid of the evidence you left on the computer.
    Me: 	I told you--
    Me: 	You're awful, you know that?
    Emily:	Yes, I do. Now go. Catch ya later.
    Me: 	Later, Em!
        Narr:	Hanging out with the girls has been fun, but you have a big day ahead of you.
        Narr:	Some peace and quiet might not be so bad.
        Me: 	(No place at camp is as relaxing as the house...)
        Narr:	You don't want to disrupt this meditative flow.
        Narr:	Checking up on the girls seems like a fun option, but you'd like to kick back and relax a bit...
        Narr:	...considering it's going to be a busy day again, soon.
        Me: 	(I should go inside. It's certainly less hot in there.)
    Narr:	There are voices coming from the office.
    Kiara:	"I feel like I've outgrown this place."
    Kiara:	"I’m not saying it isn’t fun, or that it doesn’t pay well, just that…"
    Kiara:	"…I’d like to try out other things."
    Eve:	"I get it. Life’s all about finding things you enjoy."
    Me: 	(Outgrown this place? Is she--?)
    Kiara:	"I haven’t made the decision yet, but I wanted to share my thoughts with you."
    Eve:	"Thank you for telling me."
    Eve:	"I don't have to say much we'd miss you here."
    Eve:	"But I support you whole-heartedly in everything you wish to do."
    Kiara:	"Thank you, it means a lot."
    Kiara:	"You know I'd miss you guys like crazy, too."
    Eve:	"I’m here to talk whenever. You know that."
    Kiara:	"I do. I’ll take you up on that offer, for sure."
    Kiara:	Dennis? What are you doing here?
    Me: 	I was out and about, but I wanted to get some rest...
    Me: 	...since I didn't sleep that well.
    Eve:	Dennis, can I see you for a minute?
    Me: 	(Oh, the notes!)
    Me: 	(I totally forgot about that!)
    Me: 	Sure thing.
    Kiara:	I'll see you a bit later. Dennis.
    Kiara:	Get some rest.
    Eve:	Please, sit down.
    Eve:	Are you feeling any better?
    Me: 	A bit, yeah.
    Eve:	Good, I’m glad.
    Eve:	So, you’ll be participating in sessions today.
    Eve:	Are you nervous?
    Me: 	I’m feeling a bit anxious.
    Me: 	If anything goes wrong, I’ll--
    Eve:	Be there for you.
    Eve:	Don’t think about the bad outcomes, just think about the session itself.
    Eve:	Do you remember what the first session will be about?
        Eve:	Do you remember what the first session will be about?
            Eve:	I’m glad you’ve been paying attention, Dennis.
            Eve:	This is one of the most important qualities a therapist should possess.
            Me: 	Good to know I’m off to a good start.
            Eve:	An excellent one.
            Eve:	I was hoping you’d pay more attention, Dennis.
            Me: 	(Ah, shit. Wrong answer.)
            Eve:	Attention to details is one of the most important qualities a therapist should possess.
            Me: 	Sorry, I haven’t slept that well.
            Me: 	It’s throwing me off.
            Eve:	I understand. Just be more attentive to what I say next time, okay?
            Me: 	I will, don’t worry.
    Eve:	What’s the goal for today’s session one?
    Me: 	To see what the patients think of each other.
    Eve:	Why is that important?
    Me: 	Umm, well...
    Me: 	If they don’t get along, they’ll focus more on fighting rather than the actual therapy?
    Eve:	Excellent.
    Eve:	We want them to bond and be supportive of each other.
    Eve:	To be understanding.
    Eve:	It will also put things into perspective for them.
    Me: 	Yeah. Naomi and Violet have been fighting since day 1.
    Eve:	It's better to start with compliments.
    Me: 	Hmm.
    Eve:	So, you’d ask them to share something positive about the other person.
    Eve:	Something they like about them.
    Eve:	Hearing compliments first negates some of the critique to come.
    Me: 	That makes sense.
    Eve:	Feel free to use questions of your own.
    Eve:	If you believe they’ll serve the purpose.
    Eve:	There’s one important thing for you to remember.
    Me: 	Yeah?
    Eve:	Be respectful and mindful of the situation.
    Eve:	If you feel it’s getting out of control, just--
    Me: 	Put a stop to it, and resume with a different activity.
    Eve:	I’m impressed!
    Me: 	Like I said, I’m learning from the best.
    Eve:	*Blushes* Keep up the good work.
    Me: 	(Keep me invested, and I will.)
    Me: 	I will try my best.
    Eve:	Well, that’s about it.
    Eve:	We’ll see how it goes in the actual session.
    Eve:	I’m having high hopes for you, Dennis.
    Me: 	I’ll try not to disappoint.
    Eve:	You won’t.
    Eve:	I’ll meet you at the cabins in some 20 minutes?
    Me: 	Cool! See you there!
    Me: 	Bye!
    Eve:	Bye!
Narr:	In the distance, you see Naomi sitting at the gazebo table.
Me: 	Hey Naomi. What's up?
Naomi:	Hey, Dennis.
Naomi:	Come to entertain me?
Me: 	Nah, I was just curious...
Naomi:	About?
Me: 	Why are you sitting over here all alone?
Naomi:	I needed some fresh air, and didn't want to be disturbed.
Naomi:	Looks like that didn't last long.
Me: 	Aw, come on. I thought I was a cut above the rest.
Naomi:	*Giggle* Oh, you are. I'm just teasing.
Naomi:	So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
Me: 	I just wanted to hang out with you for a bit.
Me: 	See how you're doing.
Naomi:	How thoughtful.
Me: 	Well, I'm something of a gentleman myself.
Naomi:	Yes, you are, Dennis.
Naomi:	So...
Naomi:	What's on your mind?
    Naomi:	What's on your mind?
        Me: 	I'm curious if you've noticed anything weird in the past few days.
        Naomi:	Did my story really get to you that much, Dennis?
            Naomi:	Did my story really get to you that much, Dennis?
                Me: 	No... I was actually wondering if you saw or heard anything around the cabins.
                Naomi:	Hmm... I don't think so. But...
                    Naomi:	Hmm... I don't think so. But...
                Me: 	It was pretty spooky. Are you working on any new stories?
        Me: 	I just wanted to know how you've been doing.
        Naomi:	How considerate of you. I'm doing well, Dennis. But, that's not what this is really about... is it?
            Naomi:	How considerate of you. I'm doing well, Dennis. But, that's not what this is really about... is it?
                Me: 	You got me. I was also wondering if you noticed anything weird around the cabins last night.
                Naomi:	Not that I can think of right now. But maybe...
                    Naomi:	Not that I can think of right now. But maybe...
                Me: 	Well... I was also curious to see if you've been working on any new stories.
Naomi:	I'd rather not say.
Naomi:	What exactly did you want to learn?
Naomi:	Something naughty about the other girls?
Naomi:	How unprofessional, Dennis.
Me: 	My professionalism is the reason I'm asking.
Naomi:	Oh, really?
Me: 	I'm just trying to make sure everyone is safe.
Naomi:	You sure?
Me: 	Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Me: 	At camp.
Me: 	Spending my summer with you girls.
Naomi:	Oh, yeah.
Naomi:	Speaking of the girls...
Naomi:	I want you to tell me something. What do you think of the other girls?
    Naomi:	I want you to tell me something. What do you think of the other girls?
        Naomi:	That's not what I meant. Do you think they're attractive?
            Naomi:	That's not what I meant. Do you think they're attractive?
                Me: 	That's a loaded question, isn't it? Are you trying to test my faith or something?
                Naomi:	I was just teasing you, but... now I'm actually curious what you think.
                    Naomi:	I was just teasing you, but... now I'm actually curious what you think.
                        Me: 	I think you're the most attractive, Naomi. Despite you pulling my arm.
                        Me: 	I'd rather remain neutral. You're all pretty girls, Naomi.
                Me: 	Naomi, I don't care how they look. You're the cutest girl here.
        Naomi:	I really hope you're not talking about me.
            Naomi:	I really hope you're not talking about me.
                Naomi:	Ah, the cultist and the nympho. Why are they on your mind? Do you think they're cute?
                    Naomi:	Ah, the cultist and the nympho. Why are they on your mind? Do you think they're cute?
                        Me: 	How could I think of them when the cutest girl at camp is sitting in front of me?
                        Me: 	I'd like to plead the fifth. You're all really cute girls, okay?
                Naomi:	Wow! You're lucky you wrapped that jab in such a nice compliment.
                    Naomi:	Wow! You're lucky you wrapped that jab in such a nice compliment.
                        Me: 	I wasn't joking! I think you're really attractive, Naomi.
                        Naomi:	Then tell me this... Am I prettier than the other girls?
                            Naomi:	Then tell me this... Am I prettier than the other girls?
Me: 	(Oh shit... She really didn't want to hear that.)
Naomi:	You think we're all attractive, huh?
Naomi:	Taking the politician's approach, I see...
Me: 	I can neither confirm nor deny that allegation.
Naomi:	God! You're no fun, Dennis!
Naomi:	Take a stance. Live a little!
Me: 	If I said you were the most attractive, would you be pleased?
Naomi:	Of course not.
Naomi:	You already spoiled the moment, and it wouldn't be genuine.
Me: 	(Yeah, I wasn't really being smooth.)
Naomi:	Look, I'll brush this off for now.
Naomi:	But, I have to go.
Naomi:	Places to be, things to do.
Me: 	Things to do at Red Falls?
Naomi:	I'm a busy girl.
Naomi:	Ciao, Dennis!
Me: 	Later, Naomi.
Me: 	(Well, that was something.)
Me: 	(This day is full of surprises.)
Me: 	(Some surprises were more... unexpected than others.)
Me: 	(I honestly can't believe I'm not dreaming.)
Naomi:	Oh, Dennis...
Naomi:	You answered correctly, peon.
Naomi:	I believe your service is worthy of a promotion.
Me: 	Is the queen going to knight me?
Naomi:	Of course not. Your journey has just begun.
Naomi:	You are my squire!
Naomi:	But, keep up this pace and you'll be a knight before the new moon.
Me: 	My thanks.
Naomi:	Unfortunately, I believe our time here is up.
Naomi:	I must take my leave.
Naomi:	Goodbye, noble squire.
Me: 	Goodbye, Lady Naomi.
Me: 	(Well, that was something.)
Me: 	(This day is full of surprises.)
Me: 	(Some surprises were more... unexpected than others.)
Me: 	(I honestly can't believe I'm not dreaming.)
Naomi:	Did I hear anything?
Naomi:	Hmm...
Naomi:	What will you do for me in return?
Me: 	(She always has to get something out of it, doesn't she?)
Me: 	I don't know, Naomi.
Me: 	What do you want?
Naomi:	What do I want...
Naomi:	What do I want?
Me: 	I don't know, probably something that goes against The Guidelines?
Naomi:	Dennis, I thought we were past that.
Me: 	Well, I mean--
Naomi:	Ssshh. I'm just messing with you.
Naomi:	I did hear something...
Naomi:	It sounded like a loud bang. So loud it woke me up.
Me: 	How late was it?
Naomi:	Oh, I don't know it was pretty early in the morning.
Naomi:	Definitely a while before sunrise.
Me: 	Where did the sound come from?
Naomi:	It sounded like it came from outside.
    Me: 	(So, Naomi heard it too...)
    Me: 	(It has to be Stacy.)
Naomi:	After the bang that woke me up...
Naomi:	It sounded like someone was shuffling around for a decent amount of time.
Naomi:	Then the sound stopped and I fell asleep again.
Me: 	That's it?
Naomi:	Yep, that's all I remember.
Me: 	Do you have any clue who it was?
Naomi:	Well, Violet was still in bed, so it couldn't have been her.
Naomi:	I don't know.
Me: 	Hmm... So strange.
Naomi:	It seems I've left you with a lot to ponder.
Naomi:	So, I'll leave you to it.
Me: 	Thanks for the information.
Me: 	It has given me more to work with.
Naomi:	Ciao!
Me: 	Later, Naomi.
    Me: 	(Another confirmation that someone left their cabin last night...)
    Me: 	(I hope I see Stacy soon.)
Me: 	(Well, that was something.)
Me: 	(This day is full of surprises.)
Me: 	(Some surprises were more... unexpected than others.)
Me: 	(I honestly can't believe I'm not dreaming.)
Naomi:	New stories?
Naomi:	Well, I do have some ideas I'm working on.
Me: 	Oh, really?
Me: 	So, you were inspired by your surroundings?
Naomi:	I must confess, it is very pretty out here.
Naomi:	And, the night is so still.
Me: 	Yeah, it can get kinda spooky out here.
Me: 	Especially when the night is unnaturally silent.
Naomi:	Yep. It's as if the forest knows something is lurking out there.
Naomi:	But, to get back to your question...
Naomi:	I am working on something, currently.
Naomi:	It is about this camp, but it's different from my first story.
Me: 	Oh? You've piqued my interest.
Naomi:	I haven't laid everything out yet.
Naomi:	But, I have figured out the monster.
Me: 	Another inhuman abomination?
Naomi:	No, I went a different direction.
Naomi:	I took a walk one night and saw the fireflies around the lake.
Me: 	You did? Isn't it breathtaking?
Naomi:	It is... and very ethereal.
Me: 	Oh?
Naomi:	I saw the fireflies and thought of something.
Naomi:	I imagined a phantom that rises from the lake in a cloud of fireflies.
Naomi:	Sort of like the lady of the lake.
Me: 	It is a little similar, but I like it.
Me: 	I think there's some potential there.
Naomi:	Some?
Me: 	Okay, more than some.
Naomi:	Anyway, I have a lot more work to do with that seed of an idea.
Naomi:	It'll be some time before it becomes a real story.
Me: 	Well, I volunteer to be the first person the story scares.
Naomi:	Thank you, Dennis. Your sacrifice will not be in vain.
Naomi:	But, you'll have to be patient.
Me: 	*Chuckle* I think I can manage.
Naomi:	I think I'm needed elsewhere, Dennis.
Naomi:	Bye, for now.
Me: 	See you later, Naomi.
Me: 	(Well, that was something.)
Me: 	(This day is full of surprises.)
Me: 	(Some surprises were more... unexpected than others.)
Me: 	(I honestly can't believe I'm not dreaming.)
    Me: 	(Naomi's probably sleeping. I shouldn't bother her.)
            Narr:	Where should Dennis go?
Belle:	Come in!
Me: 	Did you lose something?
Belle:	Not much to lose since we couldn't even bring anything interesting.
Me: 	You were pretty crafty if my memory serves me right...
    Belle:	Years of experience.
    Belle:	But, you had to spoil all the fun by taking my companion.
    Me: 	I just followed The Guidelines.
    Belle:	You don't seem too eager to follow them now.
    Me: 	Things change. What can I say?
    Belle:	That's good to hear...
    Belle:	Years of experience.
    Belle:	I guess you appreciate my craftiness, since you let me keep my companion.
    Me: 	It's a nice quality to have. I wanted to see just how crafty you are.
    Belle:	Stay tuned, then...
Belle:	What do you think?
Me: 	That everything looks great on you.
Belle:	Such a charmer.
Me: 	You don't mind people seeing you naked all the time?
Belle:	If I minded, do you think I'd be good at what I do?
Me: 	Point taken.
Belle:	So?
Me: 	Not bad!
Belle:	So, what have you been up to, Dennis?
    Belle:	So, what have you been up to, Dennis?
        Me: 	Nothing much. Just walked around the camp for a bit.
        Belle:	Did you see anything interesting?
        Me: 	I mostly enjoyed the quiet morning.
        Belle:	There's something else you might enjoy more.
            Belle:	There's something else you might enjoy more.
        Belle:	Why are you looking for her?
            Belle:	Why are you looking for her?
                Belle:	She did act a bit strange. But, I'd rather we talk about us.
                    Belle:	She did act a bit strange. But, I'd rather we talk about us.
                Belle:	How sweet of you. You can check up on me, too...
                    Belle:	How sweet of you. You can check up on me, too...
Belle:	Stacy, Stacy...
Belle:	She was restless in her sleep last night.
Belle:	Mumbling some weird things.
Me: 	What was she saying?
Belle:	I don't remember much. Something about an apparition. Some phantom.
Belle:	There was panic in her voice.
Me: 	Phantom?
Belle:	Yes. Ugh, why does it matter, anyway?
Belle:	It was just a dream.
Me: 	Hmm... Why do you think she sounded panicked?
Belle:	How would I know? I'm not a dream interpreter.
Me: 	I don't know. You spend the most time with her.
Me: 	If anyone would know something, that would be you.
Belle:	Well, we're not that connected. 
Belle:	She hasn't mentioned anything to me, so I really don't know what's going on with her.
Belle:	But, if some phantoms are visiting her during the night, I don't want to sleep in there anymore!
Me: 	I'm sure no one is visiting Stacy in her dreams, Belle.
Me: 	You're safe here.
Me: 	But, I am worried about her.
Belle:	She's a big girl, Dennis. She can take care of herself.
Belle:	Besides, Dr. Eve would notice something is wrong with her, no?
Me: 	Hmm, maybe.
Belle:	If there's any more creepy talk, I'll let you know. Okay?
Me: 	(Obviously Belle isn't willing to talk about Stacy anymore.)
Me: 	(I should drop this for now.)
Me: 	That would be great, Belle. Thank you.
Belle:	You're very welcome.
Belle:	You can express your gratitude in other ways, too.
    Belle:	You can express your gratitude in other ways, too.
Belle:	I'm having some thoughts...
Me: 	I'm not sure if I know what you mean...
Belle:	Does this freshen up your memory?
Me: 	A bit. It's still too blurry.
Narr:	Belle riding you makes your cock start to throb.
Me: 	This is better. I'm starting to remember more...
Belle:	Mmm, that's good to hear.
Belle:	So you're a slow learner?
Me: 	With a good teacher, I can be a faster one.
Belle:	Sex ed was always my favorite subject in school.
Narr:	Belle's sweet lips taste like candy.
Narr:	Unable to resist her, you slip her some tongue.
Narr:	Her soft moans excite you even more and she kisses you harder.
Belle:	Say Dennis, my pussy is reeeally wet.
Belle:	I'm dying for you to take care of it.
Belle:	Would you give me this pleasure?
    Belle:	Would you give me this pleasure?
    Narr:	The stress of someone catching you red-handed gets the better of you.
    Me: 	I think we should stop, Belle.
    Me: 	If someone catches us, we're both out of here.
    Belle:	Then we could have sex whenever, and wherever.
    Me: 	I'm sorry, Belle. I can't.
    Belle:	Fine. I'll take care of it myself.
    Narr:	The stress of someone catching you red-handed makes you nervous.
    Me: 	I don't think we should do this right now, Belle.
    Me: 	If someone catches us, we're both out of here.
    Belle:	Then we could have sex whenever, and wherever.
    Me: 	I'm sorry, Belle. It's just not a good idea.
    Belle:	Fine. I'll take care of it myself.
    Me: 	I'll go now. We'll talk later, okay?
    Belle:	You're no fun...
Me: 	(Well, that was something.)
Me: 	(This day is full of surprises.)
Me: 	(Some surprises were more... unexpected than others.)
Me: 	(I honestly can't believe I'm not dreaming.)
    Me: 	Of course.
    Belle:	Excellent choice, Dennis.
Belle:	Unzip your pants.
Belle:	And, here comes the prize...
Belle:	Oh, my...
Me: 	It's not fair, you still have your clothes on.
Belle:	Is it, now?
Belle:	Is this better?
Me: 	Much better.
Narr:	Lost in the moment, you're mesmerized by Belle's naked body.
Narr:	Sticking your throbbing cock into her wet pussy is the only thing on your mind now.
Belle:	Lie on the bed and close your eyes.
Narr:	You're not sure what she is planning to do, but you're getting really impatient.
Narr:	Belle's pussy on your mouth surprises you, but then you're hit with...
Narr:	...her lips around your cock.
Belle:	Mmm, Dennis. This feels aaamazing.
Narr:	Without saying a word, you focus on Belle's clit, slowly circling your tongue on its surface.
Belle:	*Glug*
Belle:	Mmmhm...
Narr:	You trace your tongue up and down Belle's pussy, making her moan louder.
Belle:	OOOoohh... Fuuuck yeeeah...
Belle:	It feels so good...
Belle:	Don't stop...
Belle:	"Don't stop, Dennis."
Kiara:	What?! Are they...?
Kiara:	What the hell is going on here?!
Me: 	Kiara, it's not what it--
Kiara:	Seems? I think it's perfectly clear what you're doing!
Me: 	Belle, get off!
Belle:	I don't mind her.
Me: 	Belle!
Kiara:	So this is what you've been doing all this time?!
Kiara:	Fucking Belle and the others?!
Me: 	No, I haven't! Kiara...
Kiara:	Wait until I tell Eve about this...
Me: 	What the fuck, Kiara?!
Kiara:	Let go of me!
Me: 	You're not so innocent yourself!
Kiara:	Excuse me?
Me: 	If you tell Eve about this, I'm sure she'll be interested about the Forest Sucker.
Me: 	So lets talk about this, okay?
Kiara:	That's how it's going to be?
Kiara:	You threatening me?
Me: 	I'm not. But you're acting like a saint, and you're far from it.
Belle:	I have a suggestion...
Belle:	She can join in on our fun...
Kiara:	What?! I'm not a lesbian!
Belle:	I didn't say you were. We can share Dennis.
Belle:	I don't see why we couldn't turn this into a positive experience.
Belle:	Instead of fighting.
Belle:	Have you ever been with a woman?
Kiara:	No, but...
Belle:	How do you know you won't enjoy it then?
Narr:	You hope Belle was convincing enough.
Narr:	If Kiara reports this all hell will break lose.
Me: 	I'd like you to join us. I think it could be fun.
Me: 	At least think about it.
    Kiara:	There's nothing to think about. I won't be someone's second choice.
    Kiara:	It's clear you're interested more in the patients...
    Me: 	Kiara... That's not...
    Kiara:	Whatever!
    Kiara:	If I catch you one more time, I'll tell Eve about this.
    Kiara:	Are we clear?
    Me: 	Tone it down, Kiara. Unless you want your secrets exposed as well.
    Me: 	I don't appreciate your threats.
    Narr:	You're pissed that Kiara acts so self-righteous...
    Narr:	...when she's really no different than you.
    Belle:	That was hot.
    Me: 	Fighting excites you?
    Belle:	You haven't really showed your rough side much.
    Belle:	I'd like to see more of it.
    Me: 	In that case...
    Belle:	Mmm... I like where this is going...
    Belle:	Mmm, keep going...
    Belle:	Oooh! Umpfh!
    Me: 	Is that rough enough for you?
    Belle:	I'm a big girl, I can take it.
    Belle:	Mmm, that's what I wanted.
    Belle:	Fuck me into oblivion, Dennis. Make me more wet.
    Narr:	Her words give you more momentum, and you start fucking her harder.
    Me: 	Fuck!
    Belle:	*Moans loudly*
    Belle:	Aaah! MMMmmm.
    Belle:	This is--
    Me: 	Turn around.
    Belle:	Mmm, hearing you boss me around turns me on even more.
    Belle:	*Slurp* *Umfph*
    Me: 	*Grunt*
    Narr:	Her muffled moans are making it hard not to cum into her mouth right now.
    Narr:	You start rubbing her clit harder, as she puts your cock deeper in her mouth.
    Narr:	Belle's getting more restless which means she's close to cumming.
    Narr:	You both twitch in pleasure and you're ready to unload.
        Belle:	Ahhhh! Ooooh.
        Belle:	Yeees! Aaaaah!
        Me: 	*Grunts* Fuck!
        Narr:	You lie on the bed, unable to move.
        Me: 	Wow, Belle.
        Belle:	I could do this all day, every day.
        Me: 	You know, I think I could get used to this, too.
        Belle:	Oh, do you?
        Belle:	How exciting...
        Me: 	Aaaahh... Yeah.
        Me: 	This is the lif--
        Belle:	Ahhhh! Ooooh.
        Belle:	Yeees! Aaaaah!
        Me: 	*Grunts* Fuck!
        Narr:	You lie on the bed, unable to move.
        Me: 	Wow, Belle.
        Belle:	I could do this all day, every day.
        Me: 	You know, I think I could get used to this, too.
        Belle:	Oh, do you?
        Belle:	How exciting...
        Me: 	Aaaahh... Yeah.
        Me: 	This is the lif--
        Belle:	Ahhhh! Ooooh.
        Belle:	Yeees! Aaaaah!
        Me: 	*Grunts* Fuck!
        Narr:	You lie on the bed, unable to move.
        Me: 	Wow, Belle.
        Belle:	I could do this all day, every day.
        Me: 	You know, I think I could get used to this, too.
        Belle:	Oh, do you?
        Belle:	How exciting...
        Me: 	Aaaahh... Yeah.
        Me: 	This is the lif--
    Narr:	Suddenly, you remember you're naked in a patient's cabin, so you hastily put on your clothes.
    Me: 	Shit...
    Me: 	I have to go. I'm probably needed elsewhere.
    Me: 	But, this was really nice, Belle.
        Belle:	Thanks for a lovely time, handsome.
        Belle:	Thanks for a lovely time, handsome.
        Belle:	Thanks for a lovely time, handsome.
    Kiara:	I don't want to touch Belle.
    Belle:	Don't worry about that.
    Kiara:	Yeah... no.
    Kiara:	Why wouldn't I worry about that?
    Belle:	Because you shouldn't take everything in life so seriously.
    Kiara:	Belle, this is my job.
    Belle:	Yeah, and?
    Kiara:	You don't think it's wrong for staff to fuck patients?
    Belle:	Why not? People are people?
    Belle:	And, we're all consenting adults.
    Kiara:	I mean, yeah that is true...
    Kiara:	But, our guidelines were put in place to protect patients.
    Belle:	Protect them from what? Fun?
    Kiara:	No, from getting taken advantage of.
    Belle:	Kiara, I want this.
    Belle:	I don't think anyone here is getting taken advantage of.
    Kiara:	Well...
    Kiara:	I mean... Yeah, I guess you're right.
    Belle:	Good, then follow along.
    Kiara:	I'm not going to fuck you, Belle.
    Belle:	Who said you'd be focusing on me?
    Kiara:	What are you planning?
    Belle:	I think it's better if I just show you.
    Belle:	Why don't you both come here?
    Belle:	I'd like you to lie on the bed, Kiara.
    Belle:	Just relax. Deep breaths.
    Kiara:	I'm not sure this--
    Belle:	Shhh. Don't talk.
    Narr:	Not even in your wildest dreams did you imagine being in a threesome here at camp.
    Me: 	(Thank you, summer break.)
    Kiara:	Mmmm.
    Me: 	Mmm, this feels good!
    Belle:	*Hmph*
    Narr:	You decide to get in the action more.
    Belle:	MMMhhm! Yees!
    Narr:	Kiara and Belle both moan in unison which is driving you wild.
    Narr:	You keep the momentum going by thrusting your cock deeper into Belle.
    Belle:	*Muffled moans* MMmm, I want all of you inside me.
    Me: 	*Grunts*
    Narr:	Your cock effortlessly slides in and out of Belle.
    Narr:	Her perfect ass rocks in unison.
    Belle:	Stop, Dennis.
    Me: 	What? Is something wrong?
    Belle:	No, no. But I'd like to try something else.
    Belle:	Lie down, Dennis.
    Me: 	Umm, okay?
    Belle:	I'd like Kiara to sit on you.
    Kiara:	Like this?
    Belle:	Yeah.
    Me: 	*Grunts*
    Kiara:	*Moans* Oh, Dennis...
    Kiara:	Someone's feeling feisty.
    Belle:	Why don't we try out something else?
    Kiara:	Something else?
    Belle:	Mhm... Something kinkier.
    Belle:	Let me show you...
    Narr:	The three of your reposition yourselves, following Belle's lead.
    Me: 	How? Like this?
    Belle:	Exactly, just... like... that.
    Narr:	Belle's wet pussy pressed on your face makes you fuck Kiara even harder.
        Narr:	Taking Belle's subtle hint...
        Narr:	You decide to switch things up.
    Belle:	Oh fuck, Dennis!
    Belle:	This is perfect...
    Narr:	You slide your tongue in Belle's pussy...
    Narr:	...while Kiara rides you, hard.
    Kiara:	*Moans* Gah! You're in so deep, Dennis!
    Kiara:	Don't...
    Kiara:	...don't stop!
    Narr:	You continue licking Belle's pussy as she slides her clitoris up and down your tongue.
    Belle:	Aaaah!
    Kiara:	*Pant* Keep...
    Kiara:	*Pant* Going...
    Belle:	MMmmmm, yeeeees...
    Me: 	Mmmffm... Fuuuck.
    Belle:	Is this good enough for you, Dennis?
    Belle:	Don't you fucking love this?
    Narr:	Taking Belle's subtle hint...
    Narr:	You decide to switch things up.
    Me: 	Wait a second...
    Me: 	I've always wanted to try this.
    Belle:	Ooooh... I understand.
    Kiara:	What is it?
    Belle:	Follow my lead, Kiara.
    Kiara:	Oooohh...
    Kiara:	Kinky.
    Kiara:	(This girl really is a nympho!)
    Belle:	*Gasp* You could have warned me, you know.
    Kiara:	Wouldn't that kill the surprise?
    Me: 	Mmmmmm... Yeah...
    Belle:	You're right...
    Belle:	It would.
    Kiara:	*Gasp* Okay, okay.
    Kiara:	Sorry... jeez.
    Me: 	Ladies... Ladies.
    Me: 	Let's all just have a good time.
    Belle:	It was just a little teasing.
    Belle:	I thought you like teasing, Dennis?
    Me: 	I like this kind of teasing.
    Belle:	You hear that Kiara?
    Kiara:	Oh. Yeah...
    Belle:	Come on, let's make Dennis feel fucking amazing.
    Me: 	*Moans* Fuck... fuck yeah.
    Belle:	Is this good enough for you, Dennis?
    Belle:	Do you fucking love this?
    Narr:	Taking Belle's subtle hint...
    Narr:	You decide to switch things up.
    Me: 	Hold on...
    Me: 	How about this?
    Belle:	I'm fine with this...
    Belle:	...if Kiara is.
    Belle:	We wouldn't want to leave her out of all the fun.
    Kiara:	It's fine...
    Kiara:	I'm not feeling left out.
    Me: 	You sure?
    Kiara:	Yeah, I know how to please myself very well.
    Belle:	Years of experience?
    Kiara:	Something like that.
    Kiara:	Does this satisfy some fetish that you both have?
    Me: 	This feels like a dream.
    Belle:	Mmm...
    Belle:	Oh, honey...
    Belle:	This isn't a dream.
    Me: 	Fuuuck...
    Belle:	Is this good enough for you, Dennis?
    Belle:	Don't you just love this?
Belle:	You don't need to answer that.
Belle:	I know you love this...
Me: 	Maybe... I do.
Kiara:	MMmmmmm...
Narr:	The girls' muffled moans are making it hard not to cum into Belle's mouth right now.
Narr:	You start rubbing both of them more passionately, harder.
Narr:	It's clear to you that Kiara and Belle are close to cumming.
Narr:	The three of you twitch in ecstasy, and you're ready to unload.
    Belle:	Ahhhh! Ooooh.
    Belle:	Yeees! Aaaaah!
    Me: 	*Grunts* Fuck!
    Narr:	You lie on the bed, unable to move.
    Me: 	Wow, ladies...
    Belle:	I could do this all day, every day.
    Kiara:	I don't think that's such a good idea...
    Kiara:	You did just fuck a patient.
    Me: 	(Oh shit!)
    Narr:	Suddenly, you remember you're butt-naked in a patient's cabin...
    Narr:	So, you hastily put on your clothes.
    Me: 	You know, so did you, Kiara.
    Me: 	Wait up, Kiara!
    Me: 	Fuck...
    Me: 	I have to go, Belle. I should go after Kiara...
    Me: 	...as much as I'd like to stay.
    Belle:	Aww... Are you sure you have to go?
    Me: 	Yeah, I'm certain.
    Belle:	Well...
    Belle:	Thanks for a lovely time, handsome.
    Belle:	Ahhhh! Ooooh.
    Belle:	Yeees! Aaaaah!
    Me: 	*Grunts* Fuck!
    Narr:	You lie on the bed, unable to move.
    Me: 	Wow, ladies...
    Belle:	I could do this all day, every day.
    Kiara:	I don't think that's such a good idea...
    Kiara:	You did just fuck a patient.
    Me: 	(Oh shit!)
    Narr:	Suddenly, you remember you're butt-naked in a patient's cabin...
    Narr:	So, you hastily put on your clothes.
    Me: 	You know, so did you, Kiara.
    Me: 	Wait up, Kiara!
    Me: 	Fuck...
    Me: 	I have to go, Belle. I should go after Kiara...
    Me: 	...as much as I'd like to stay.
    Belle:	Aww... Are you sure you have to go?
    Me: 	Yeah, I'm certain.
    Belle:	Well...
    Belle:	Thanks for a lovely time, handsome.
Me: 	Yeah... I really do.
Me: 	Fuuuck...
Me: 	Yeeeah.
Narr:	Belle and Kiara look deep into your eyes.
Narr:	Not long after, you feel the rising tension of orgasm.
Me: 	I'm gonna...
Belle:	Do it.
Belle:	*Moan* Unload on us, Dennis...
Me: 	*Moan* Yesssss...
Kiara:	This was--
Belle:	Something. Wasn't it?
Kiara:	I don't even know what this was.
Narr:	After a few moments of silence...
Kiara:	I have to go.
Kiara:	I think you should, too, Dennis.
Narr:	Kiara puts her clothes back on and heads out the door.
Me: 	Kiara's right...
Me: 	I should go, too.
Belle:	Noooo... Come on, Dennis.
Belle:	Stay here a little longer.
Belle:	It'll be worth your time.
Me: 	Belle, Belle...
Me: 	I'd love to, but you know I have to go.
Me: 	Thank you for such a unique experience.
Belle:	Honestly... I should be thanking you.
Belle:	That was the best time I've had since getting here.
Belle:	Sooo...
Belle:	Swing by anytime, sexy.
Narr:	Still awestruck by what you just participated in...
Narr:	you get dressed quickly and head out.
Me: 	Yeah... I... do.
Kiara:	Oooohhh, fuuuuck.
Me: 	I'm gonna cum.
Kiara:	*Pant* Me... me too.
Belle:	*Moans* Mmmfff...
Me: 	Shiiiiii--
Narr:	In a state of frenzy, the three of you cum simultaneously.
Narr:	You're smothered by Belle's orgasming pussy.
    Narr:	But, you still manage to pull out and cum on Kiara's stomach.
    Narr:	But, you still manage to pull out and cum on Kiara's perfect pussy.
Kiara:	This was...
Kiara:	I don't even know what this was.
Narr:	After a few moments of silence...
Kiara:	I have to go.
Narr:	Kiara puts her clothes back on and heads out the door.
Me: 	I should go, too.
Belle:	Oh, come on.
Belle:	Can't you stay here a little longer?
Belle:	I'll make it worth your tiiiime.
Me: 	(She's really relentless...)
Me: 	Belle, Belle...
Me: 	I'd love to, but you know I have to go...
Me: 	Thank you for such a lovely time, Belle.
Belle:	Honestly... I should be thanking you.
Belle:	That was the best time I've had since getting here.
Belle:	Sooo...
Belle:	Swing by anytime, handsome.
Narr:	Still awestruck by what you just participated in...
Narr:	you get dressed quickly and head out.
Eve:	Hello, Dennis.
Eve:	Having a good day?
Me: 	I am. How are you?
Eve:	Ready for the girls' sessions.
Eve:	How are you, Dennis?
Me: 	I'm fine, thanks.
Eve:	Hmm...
Eve:	Can you come with me?
Me: 	Uh, sure. What do you need my help with?
Eve:	Oh, nothing.
Eve:	I just thought the girls would benefit from you joining the first session.
Me: 	(This could be interesting...)
Me: 	Sure, I'll play ball.
Eve:	Great. I'm happy to hear it.
        Me: 	(Where was she?)
        Me: 	(I didn't see her anywhere around camp since this morning.)
        Me: 	(She looks worried.)
Eve:	Hello, everyone!
Eve:	I hope you all used your free time well.
Belle:	Can't we get the whole day off? Therapy is boring...
Eve:	You're here for a reason, Belle.
Eve:	Unless you want to visit us every summer, I suggest taking our work here seriously.
Belle:	Doing this again is the last thing I want to do.
Naomi:	Me too.
Eve:	Today we'll be doing paired therapy.
Naomi:	A what?
Eve:	You'll be divided into two groups for the first session today.
Eve:	Dennis will be joining us today.
Me: 	I am?
Violet:	Dr. Eve, I'm not sure I'll be comfortable with someone else joining the therapy.
Eve:	I assure you it's going to be alright.
Eve:	Dennis has developed an interest in therapy, so I believe this could be a great learning opportunity for him.
Eve:	As for you, discussing your problems around someone new might help you overcome them much faster.
Eve:	The details why you came won't be discussed in this session.
Eve:	Is everyone okay with this?
Belle:	I have no problem with Dennis helping us.
Naomi:	Neither do I.
Violet:	If we won't be discussing the details, I'll be okay with that.
Eve:	Stacy?
Stacy:	Hmm?
Eve:	Would you be okay with that?
Stacy:	With what?
Eve:	With Dennis joining our session today.
Stacy:	Sure. Whatever.
Eve:	For the first session, Belle and Stacy will come with us.
Eve:	Naomi and Violet, you have some free time until we're finished.
Eve:	I ask that you wait at the gazebo...
Eve:	...so we can have some privacy.
Violet:	Of course, Dr. Eve.
Eve:	Lets begin, shall we?
Eve:	Let me just take a seat, ladies.
Belle:	Dennis, you can squeeze between us.
Me: 	Umm, I'll sit next to Dr. Eve. Three's a crowd.
Belle:	Not always. I like threesomes.
Belle:	I mean, hanging out with two more people.
Belle:	I didn't mean sex. Although... that's totally fun.
Eve:	Belle, we've talked about this...
Belle:	What?
Eve:	Stacy, how have you been feeling today?
Stacy:	I'm fine.
Eve:	You seem a bit...
Eve:	Preoccupied with your thoughts.
Stacy:	I'm always preoccupied with my thoughts.
Eve:	Did anything specific happen?
Stacy:	No.
Me: 	(She really is acting weird...)
Eve:	Well, we're here to listen if you need us. Let's continue.
Eve:	Today's session will be focused on your opinions of each other.
Eve:	Do you think that's important?
Stacy:	Probably.
Eve:	Can you elaborate further?
Stacy:	Not really.
Me: 	(What's going on with her? She was never this gloomy.)
Eve:	Belle?
Belle:	I never cared what anyone thought of me. It's such a waste of time.
Eve:	Would you be bothered if someone openly disliked you?
Belle:	Of course, but I don't see why anyone would dislike me.
Belle:	I'm a pleasure to hang out with.
Belle:	Right, Dennis?
Me: 	(This isn't funny anymore. Eve's getting more suspicious...)
Me: 	Yeah, you're fun.
Eve:	Stacy, do you enjoy Belle's company?
Stacy:	I don't mind her.
Eve:	Can you single out one of her most positive personality traits and one less positive one?
Stacy:	Hmm... I like that she's always in a good mood.
Stacy:	That feels nice when I'm not feeling so great.
Stacy:	Sometimes she's judgmental of my religion, though...
Stacy:	Which is mildly annoying.
Belle:	Being in a cult is totally fine with me. I'm not one to judge people.
Stacy:	See? That's what I'm talking about!
Belle:	What?
Stacy:	It's not a cult! You referring to it like that just proves my point!
Eve:	Stacy, I believe we can discuss this in a more calm way.
Belle:	I didn't...
Eve:	This type of therapy isn't meant to be offensive, or hurtful.
Stacy:	I feel like every time we talk about me, you're judging me because of my religion.
Stacy:	I do live within its prescribed norms, but that's not my whole life.
Stacy:	Nor my whole persona.
Eve:	I'm sure Belle didn't mean it like that.
Stacy:	Dr. Eve?
Stacy:	I'm not feeling up for today's session. May I be excused?
Eve:	I'd like you to stay and give me 5 more minutes.
Eve:	Can you describe how you're feeling right now?
Stacy:	On edge would be the most appropriate description.
Eve:	Did anything specific happen or is it just a momentary feeling?
Stacy:	I'm not sure. It's just how I'm feeling at the moment.
Stacy:	It's been building up, I guess.
Eve:	Do you feel like you're receiving support here from the other girls?
Stacy:	We don't confide in each other, really.
Eve:	Do you think you can build friendships here?
Stacy:	Maybe. We'll see.
Eve:	Thank you for your patience, Stacy.
Eve:	Go rest and we'll continue this later.
Me: 	Should someone go after her?
Eve:	No, let her be. She needs to calm down.
Eve:	Some alone time is better for her right now.
Belle:	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset her.
Eve:	It's not your fault, Belle. This was just a triggering event for her.
Belle:	Sooo, what is Dennis's role in all of this?
Eve:	Well, Dennis seems genuinely interested in helping others.
Eve:	I wanted him to experience the field first hand and...
Eve:	...maybe someday join the business.
Belle:	Ohh. I didn't know Dennis was interested in that...
Me: 	I've thought about it. Being helpful is fulfilling.
Belle:	Well, sign me up. You can be helpful to me anytime.
Me: 	Umm, sure...
Eve:	Okay, let's wrap this up.
Eve:	You have some time until the next session so use it as you will.
Eve:	Bye, Belle!
Belle:	Bye, Dr. Eve!
Me: 	Bye!
Eve:	Dennis, would you like to lead the second session?
Eve:	Or would you prefer to have some time off until later?
    Eve:	Or would you prefer to have some time off until later?
        Me: 	That sounds great!
        Me: 	I'd love to go.
        Eve:	Glad to hear it.
        Eve:	Let's go.
        Me: 	I'd like to ease into this, if that's fine with you.
        Me: 	The first session has been... a bit too much.
        Me: 	I'm not feeling confident enough for another one.
        Eve:	That's okay, Dennis. Baby steps.
        Eve:	Take some time off, relax.
        Eve:	Catch up with you later.
        Me: 	Thanks, Eve!
        Me: 	Good luck. See you later!
        Me: 	(I should go after Stacy and check how she’s doing.)
        Me: 	(She really didn't seem okay. Especially after that session.)
        Me: 	(Although, hanging out with Belle always ends up frisky and fun.)
        Narr:	You continue pondering the choice.
        Narr:	Stacy clearly needs your help.
        Narr:	But, in a way, so does Belle.
        Me: 	(Hmm...)
            Me: 	(Hmm...)
Me: 	(I think I should really go after Stacy...)
Me: 	(Who knows where she's disappeared to.)
Narr:	Belle notices you approaching from behind.
Belle:	Well, well. Look who picked the fun choice.
Me: 	Unfortunately... no.
Belle:	What? So, you don't wanna have some real fun with me?
Me: 	Sorry, Belle. Now's not the best time.
Belle:	Oh, you're saying later would be better?
Belle:	Maybe when the sun sets and everyone else is asleep?
Me: 	Yeah... Sure. I guess.
Me: 	Sorry, Belle. I really have to go.
Narr:	Passing Belle, you notice Stacy in the distance.
Narr:	You attempt to make up the space between you and Stacy.
Narr:	As you run after her, you try to get her attention.
Me: 	Stacy, wait up!
Narr:	Stacy seems not to care so you pick up the pace to catch up to her.
Stacy:	Let me go!
Me: 	What's going on with you?
Stacy:	Nothing.
Me: 	That's not true. You can tell me.
Me: 	You know I'll keep it between us.
Stacy:	Thank you for caring, Dennis. But, I don't know what to tell you.
Me: 	I'm listening...
Stacy:	It doesn't matter. I told you already!
Me: 	Fine. Then, we'll stand here in silence.
Narr:	A few minutes of awkward silence pass by...
Stacy:	*Sigh* It's just...
Stacy:	Everyone is really nice, but I feel like the odd one out.
Stacy:	I don't belong here. Not like the others, anyway.
Me: 	In what way?
Stacy:	It's more of a feeling. I'm not sure exactly why they're here.
Stacy:	We all come from different backgrounds, and have different stories.
Stacy:	But, I would say my problem is different than theirs.
Me: 	If you feel like that, why don't you talk to Dr. Eve about it?
Stacy:	She wouldn't understand. She analyzes us from a therapist's point of view.
Stacy:	I don't think she'd truly get what I'm thinking.
Me: 	If you feel like that, there's another possibility...
Stacy:	Which is?
Me: 	No one's holding you hostage here.
Me: 	You can leave voluntarily if this feels like it's too much.
Me: 	I don't believe Dr. Eve would force you to do anything that makes you feel sad or angry.
Stacy:	You want me to leave?
Me: 	No, of course not!
Me: 	But, I'm sad and worried seeing you like this.
Stacy:	Awww, Dennis! You're really sweet.
Me: 	That was unexpected...
Stacy:	Just wanted to thank you for being here for me. It means a lot.
Me: 	Anytime.
Me: 	So what are you going to do about this?
Stacy:	I'll wait and see how things go.
Stacy:	I owe it to myself.
Me: 	I agree. Don't rush things.
Me: 	If it means anything, I think you're brave for doing this.
Me: 	For wanting to do better in your life.
Stacy:	Thank you, Dennis.
Stacy:	I'm sorry I'm such a burden.
Me: 	You're not. Don't talk about yourself like that.
Me: 	We can talk about less gloomy things if you want.
Stacy:	Yes, please.
Me: 	Hmmm, how abooout...
Me: 	You tell me what you were like as a kid.
Stacy:	Digging deep, huh?
Me: 	No, I mean--
Stacy:	Relax, I'm teasing you.
Stacy:	I was a pain in the ass.
Me: 	Oh?
Stacy:	I was always running around, making a mess.
Stacy:	I couldn't stay still for 5 minutes...
Me: 	Your parents must have lost their temper a lot.
Stacy:	You have no idea...
Me: 	Did you get into any accidents?
Stacy:	A couple, yeah.
Stacy:	I remember this one time I went on the balcony and wanted to fly with an umbrella, Mary Poppins style.
Me: 	*Laughs* No way!
Me: 	Did you do it?
Stacy:	No. A neighbor spoiled all the fun by telling my mom, who was back in the garden.
Me: 	That's crazy.
Stacy:	Yeah. How about yourself? Any wild childhood memories?
Me: 	Hmm, no, I was a good boy.
Stacy:	Come on! There must be something.
Me: 	Fine. There was this one thing.
Stacy:	Yes?
Me: 	I stabbed myself in the eye with the straw from my Capri Sun...
Me: 	...after wrestling with Eve over it.
Stacy:	*Bursts out laughing*
Me: 	I had to go to a hospital. I wore an eye patch for like a week.
Stacy:	I haven't laughed so much in a while.
Stacy:	Thank you, Dennis.
Me: 	No problem. I'm glad my pain and suffering amused you.
Stacy:	I'm up for funny stories anytime.
Me: 	Oh, then I'm going to be a goldmine to you.
Me: 	But, that'll have to wait.
Me: 	I have to go and take care of some things at the house.
Me: 	I'll catch you later, okay?
Stacy:	Sure thing. Bye, Dennis! And thank you for cheering me up.
Me: 	Of course. Bye, Stacy!
Me: 	(I think I should probably give Stacy some space...)
Me: 	(All day people have been asking her over and over if she's okay.)
Me: 	(I'd feel suffocated if that were me.)
Narr:	While you think, and walk...
Narr:	Belle approaches you from behind.
Belle:	Well, well. Look who picked the fun choice.
Me: 	I just want to be helpful. You know?
Belle:	Oh, I'd love it if you made yourself helpful to me.
Me: 	Depends on what you mean by helpful...
Belle:	I'm very creative. Come with me.
Me: 	Umm, okay...
Belle:	Make yourself comfortable.
Me: 	(I wonder what tricks Belle has planned for me now...)
Belle:	What do you say we play a game?
Belle:	I'd like to tap into who Dennis really is...
Me: 	Oh, how thoughtful of you.
Belle:	You think I'm only interested in sex?
Me: 	Well...
Belle:	It's not far from the truth, but there's more to me than that...
Me: 	I believe you. So... Who is Belle, really?
Belle:	You tell me.
Me: 	A woman with many secrets. Very generous and hard to resist.
Belle:	Heading in the right direction...
Me: 	Full of surprises.
Belle:	Mhm...
Me: 	Very playful and direct.
Belle:	Not bad, Dennis.
Belle:	It seems like you've been paying attention...
Belle:	Mr. maybe-to-be-counselor, I believe I'm up next.
Belle:	Have you ever played a game called Build a Story?
Me: 	No... What's it about?
Belle:	You start with a sentence, and I add another one. 
Belle:	We build a story together, taking turns.
Belle:	Why don't you start first?
Me: 	Hmm... Okay.
Me: 	A strange man was sitting on a bench...
Belle:	...when a stunning woman approached him.
Me: 	He seemed very preoccupied with his thoughts, and didn't notice her at first.
Belle:	The woman sat really close to him and asked him if he's from around here.
Me: 	"I am. Why are you asking?"
Belle:	"I just wanted to know if you know any good restaurants around. I'm starving."
Me: 	The man said he knows a few places. "There's a steakhouse just around the corner."
Belle:	"Would you like to join me? You seem like you need some company."
Me: 	The man thought about it for a few seconds before replying, "that wouldn't be such a bad idea."
Belle:	At dinner, the woman asked him why he seems sad.
Me: 	The man answered that he's recently gone through a breakup and is still processing it.
Belle:	The woman was very charming and sweet, so by the end, the man asked her to join him for drink at his place.
Me: 	After a couple of drinks, the woman seemed really flirty.
Belle:	She leaned in for a kiss...
Narr:	He pulled her closer and they kissed passionately.
Belle:	He couldn't resist her so he put his hand on her shirt...
Me: 	And gently played with her tits.
Belle:	She wanted more so she grabbed his other hand and put it inside her panties.
Me: 	He got turned on more by playing with her clit.
Belle:	So she grabbed his crotch, feeling his hard on poking her hand.
Belle:	She took it out...
Belle:	Wrapped her soft hands around it...
Belle:	And started stroking it.
Belle:	They both enjoyed the sensations and surrendered themselves to it.
Narr:	Suddenly, you hear noises from outside.
Me: 	Belle, wait...
Me: 	I think someone's outside.
Stacy:	What's going on here?
Me: 	Belle and I were talking.
Stacy:	Oh, about what?
Belle:	Just getting to know each other more.
Stacy:	Cool.
Me: 	I'll let you two catch up.
Belle:	Aww, don't leave now.
Stacy:	Yeah, you can stay if you want.
Me: 	(With a hard on? Don't think so.)
Me: 	It's okay. Catch you guys later...
Stacy:	Okay, Dennis. See you later.
Belle:	Later, Dennis.
Me: 	Phew! That was close.
Narr:	Having agreed to lead the second session, you head toward the gazebo.
Narr:	Approaching the gazebo, you spot Violet and Naomi talking.
Me: 	(I'm kinda nervous now.)
Me: 	(I’m glad Eve is here if anything goes wrong.)
Me: 	(They might start going at each other.)
Eve:	Hello, ladies!
Eve:	How is everyone feeling today?
Naomi:	I'd be better if it wasn't getting hotter every day.
Violet:	It's summer. Maybe if you dressed appropriately...
Naomi:	And, how is that any of your business?
Naomi:	I have delicate skin. I'm certainly not risking any sunburns.
Eve:	Ladies... Have you heard of the Gottman Method?
Eve:	So that's a no.
Eve:	How about you, Dennis?
Me: 	I'm with them.
Eve:	Okay, so... The basic idea is that unresolved conflicts are a norm and...
Eve:	...can be manageable through positive communication, rather than criticism.
Eve:	Do you believe your communication a moment ago was positive?
Violet:	No...
Eve:	Criticism, contempt, defensiveness and stonewalling are the four horsemen of a relationship's demise.
Naomi:	We're not in a relationship.
Eve:	Relationship refers to both romantic relations, as well as platonic ones.
Eve:	In order for your stay here to be successful, a positive environment must be present.
Eve:	Naomi, wouldn't it be easier for you if you and Violet were more supportive of each other?
Naomi:	Of course, but...
Eve:	Then that is our goal here.
Eve:	Attachment bonding between patients has proven to aid the success of therapy itself.
Eve:	So let's start with something simple.
Eve:	Dennis, You can take it from here.
Me: 	(Oh, shit!)
Eve:	Remember what we spoke about earlier.
Eve:	You'll do great.
Eve:	Don't worry.
Narr:	Slightly nervous, but determined to do well, you go on.
Me: 	*Clears throat*
Me: 	Single out one positive personality trait of the other person.
Eve:	Let's start with Dennis.
Me: 	Huh?
Eve:	What do you think Naomi and Violet's best features are?
Me: 	Umm... Ahem.
Me: 	Violet is very polite and enjoys teaching others the beauty of physical activity.
Me: 	Naomi seems guarded, but underneath she is tender and sweet.
Naomi:	Awww, thank you, Dennis!
Eve:	You're very perceptive, Dennis. Thoughtful, too.
Eve:	(Really perceptive...)
Eve:	Go on, Dennis.
Me: 	(Okay. Think! What to ask them now?)
Me: 	(Oh, I got it!)
Me: 	Violet, it's your turn now.
Violet:	Well, Dennis has helped me overcome my shyness a bit. He's very sweet.
Me: 	I meant, what's the most positive thing about Naomi?
Violet:	Oh! Hmm... She's... nice sometimes?
Naomi:	Sometimes?
Violet:	Maybe we started off on the wrong foot.
Violet:	I actually haven't tried getting to know Naomi more.
Violet:	I'm sure she has nice qualities.
Violet:	Maybe I should try harder finding what those are.
Me: 	Naomi?
Naomi:	Violet is... okay. I mean, maybe she's a bit too into sports.
Naomi:	She's sweet, though. I like that.
Naomi:	And yeah... I haven't tried getting to know her, either.
Me: 	Can you tell me more about why you dislike each other?
Eve:	Those are nice questions, Dennis.
Me: 	Thank you, Dr. Eve.
Me: 	(I have no idea what I'm doing...)
Me: 	(I guess I pass as a believable therapist.)
Me: 	(Barely.)
Naomi:	She's just so different from me.
Naomi:	Dresses differently, talks differently...
Me: 	Is that a reason to openly dislike someone, and be rude to them?
Naomi:	No, but...
Me: 	Violet?
Violet:	I'm not sure why she doesn't like me, but it started to get annoying so I talked back.
Me: 	Naomi, are looks more important to you than someone's personality?
Me: 	Do you think everyone should dress and behave the same as you?
Naomi:	Of course not. I mean, it would be a better looking world, but...
Me: 	I suggest that every day, each of you does something nice for the other.
Me: 	It can be anything. A drawing, a nice gesture, an act of service...
Me: 	Utilize your interests and hobbies and make an effort to do nice things every day.
Me: 	Does that sound achievable to you?
Naomi:	Sure. I can write her a poem or something.
Violet:	You write?
Naomi:	Yes, a bit.
Violet:	Will you read me something you've written?
Naomi:	Sure. I'll show you later.
Violet:	Awesome!
Me: 	I'm glad you've decided to be more open-minded, and gentler.
Me: 	I'd like to conclude the first part of today's sessions.
Me: 	You're both excused, and may organize your time as you want.
Eve:	Very professional of you, Dennis.
Eve:	What do you think, ladies!
Eve:	Did Dennis do well?
Naomi:	He did really well.
Violet:	I quite enjoyed this session, Dr. Eve.
Violet:	I wouldn't mind Dennis taking part in it again.
Me: 	Thank you very much.
Narr:	You cast a glance at Eve, looking to see her reaction.
Me: 	(She seems happy.)
Me: 	(More points earned.)
Eve:	Ladies, you're free until the next session.
Eve:	Dennis, are you going back to the house or?
Me: 	It’s a nice day out, I was thinking of spending it outside.
Eve:	Very well. Have fun!
Eve:	I expect you to be on your best behavior, of course.
Me: 	Absolutely.
Eve:	Bye!
Me: 	Bye, Dr. Eve!
Naomi:	Bye!
Violet:	Bye, Dr. Eve!
Violet:	Dennis, would you like to join me for a walk?
Naomi:	I was going to ask the same thing.
        Me: 	I'll join Violet for now. I'll come find you later, Naomi.
        Naomi:	No need. You had your pick.
        Me: 	Naomi!
        Violet:	That escalated quickly.
        Violet:	Anyway...
        Violet:	How did you like participating in the session, Dennis?
        Me: 	It was pretty interesting.
        Me: 	I'm glad you and Naomi have decided to be nicer to each other.
        Violet:	We'll see how that goes.
        Me: 	You don't think it will work?
        Violet:	I'm having doubts. But, let's wait and see.
        Violet:	Maybe I misjudged her.
        Violet:	I certainly want to do better. But if she doesn't do the same...
        Me: 	Yeah, I get it.
        Me: 	Let's hope for the best, then.
        Violet:	It's really hot outside.
        Me: 	(Mmmmmm...)
        Violet:	Would you like to join me for a swim?
        Me: 	Huh?
        Me: 	Of course. But I'll have to go change first.
        Violet:	Meet you at the lake in 10 minutes?
        Me: 	You bet!
        Me: 	(The water looks refreshing. I can't wait to jump in.)
        Violet:	You're fast.
        Me: 	You look nice!
        Violet:	Thank you.
        Violet:	What are you waiting for?
        Me: 	I was enjoying the view.
        Violet:	So sweet.
        Violet:	Up for a challenge?
        Me: 	You betcha!
        Violet:	First one to swim from one side of the lake to another wins a prize.
        Me: 	What's the prize?
        Violet:	How abooouut...
        Violet:	The loser has to take their clothes off.
        Me: 	I'm not sure if that's a prize or punishment.
        Violet:	Depends on who wins.
        Me: 	Bring it on!
        Violet:	Ready, set...
        Me: 	Go!
        Narr:	You're thinking about letting her win, but you wouldn't mind seeing her naked.
        Me: 	(You got this!)
        Narr:	You're nearing the edge of the lake so you pick up your pace.
        Narr:	Violet is swimming alongside, and it seems like it's going to be a close race.
        Me: 	Woo! And the winner is...
        Violet:	As much as I hate to admit it...
        Violet:	You beat me fair and square.
        Me: 	So...
        Violet:	So...
        Violet:	Hold this.
        Violet:	And this.
        Violet:	I feel kinda exposed.
        Me: 	You can put it back on, if you feel uncomfortable.
        Violet:	No, no. You won fairly.
        Violet:	Though I wouldn't mind winning.
            Violet:	How's your neck?
            Me: 	Still a bit sore.
            Violet:	Turn around.
            Narr:	You feel Violet's warm breasts pressed on your back.
            Narr:	Her erect nipples are grazing your skin.
            Narr:	You're afraid someone might see you, but, from a distance, it's not that obvious Violet is naked.
            Me: 	(Fuck! Welcome back, Mr. Hard On...)
            Violet:	Is this better?
            Me: 	Mmm... Much.
            Narr:	Violet's fingers work their magic while she presses herself harder onto you.
            Narr:	You want to turn around and touch her, but seeing you're out in the open, you toss the idea away.
            Me: 	That was wonderful, Violet. Thank you.
            Violet:	You're very welcome.
            Me: 	We should head back.
            Violet:	Okay.
            Violet:	Eyes up, Dennis.
            Me: 	Sorry, I got a bit distracted.
            Violet:	By what?
            Me: 	Well... by you in front of me. Naked.
            Violet:	Stop it, Dennis.
            Me: 	I'm sorry.
        Violet:	I'll need my bikini back.
        Me: 	Oh! Almost forgot. Here you go.
        Violet:	Can you please turn around?
        Me: 	Yeah, sure.
        Violet:	All set!
        Violet:	Thank you for the challenge, Dennis.
        Me: 	Thank you for a lovely time.
        Me: 	Catch ya later?
        Violet:	Yes! Bye, Dennis!
        Me: 	Bye, Violet!
        Me: 	I'll join Naomi for now. I'll come find you later, Violet.
        Violet:	Don't be too long, Dennis.
        Me: 	I won't.
        Naomi:	How come you chose me?
        Me: 	Just felt like staying here with you.
        Me: 	Up for a walk then?
        Naomi:	Or, we could stay here and chat.
        Me: 	Let's stay here...
        Naomi:	You rarely talk about yourself, Dennis.
        Naomi:	I'd like to get to know you more...
        Me: 	Oh?
        Naomi:	For example...
        Naomi:	I've told you about my family, but you've never spoken about yours.
        Naomi:	What was your childhood like?
        Me: 	I guess not much different than anyone else's.
        Me: 	My parents worked a lot, so I spent a lot of time hanging out with other kids.
        Naomi:	Were you mischievous as a child?
        Me: 	Who wasn't? I always got into trouble.
        Naomi:	Not so much now?
        Me: 	I'm trying to make something out of my life so I keep it balanced.
        Me: 	Be a good employee here, while I'm at college--
        Naomi:	Partying.
        Me: 	I'm no stranger to parties, that's for sure.
        Me: 	But, it gets repetitive with time.
        Me: 	So I try to do different things.
        Naomi:	Such as?
        Me: 	Playing some sports with friends, going to the movies, reading, writing.
        Naomi:	Writing?
        Me: 	Well, I try to write, but I don't think it's any good.
        Naomi:	I think others would be a better judge of that.
        Naomi:	Let's hear it!
        Me: 	I don't know it by heart...
        Naomi:	Oh, come on!
        Me: 	It's mostly haiku.
        Me: 	The street lamp once out, bright stars enter the window.
        Me: 	Cherry flower shrine: Voices rise from the foothills.
        Me: 	The jay flew away: swaying in the evening sun, a leafless tree, bare.
        Naomi:	Wow... That was... unexpected. I loved it!
        Me: 	Did you really?
        Naomi:	Yes!
        Naomi:	You're talented, Dennis. Just keep practicing.
        Me: 	Thank you, Naomi. I will!
        Me: 	What made you start writing in the first place?
        Naomi:	It was just a way out of my everyday life and...
        Naomi:	...difficulties.
        Naomi:	My head was in a different space, at least for a while.
        Me: 	I know what you mean...
        Narr:	You both sit in silence for a short while, relaxing in the shade.
        Naomi:	Close your eyes!
        Me: 	Why?
        Naomi:	Just do it!
        Naomi:	Listen to the sounds around you. Imagine you're on an island...
        Naomi:	There's nothing around but you and the waves.
        Naomi:	A few birds interrupt the serenity that surrounds you.
        Me: 	Mmm...
        Naomi:	Suddenly, you feel a nice warm touch on your thigh.
        Me: 	Huh?
        Naomi:	You're mesmerized by the touch and lose yourself in the moment.
        Naomi:	You can think of nothing else but to kiss the woman.
        Naomi:	Embracing her lips with yours.
        Narr:	You kiss Naomi gently while she continues massaging your thigh.
        Me: 	You're a great storyteller, Naomi.
        Naomi:	Thanks!
        Naomi:	I wish we could do more now, but we're pretty exposed here.
        Naomi:	Maybe we can finish what we started later?
        Me: 	I'd love to.
        Naomi:	Thanks for staying with me, Dennis.
        Me: 	Of course!
        Naomi:	Later!
        Me: 	See you later, Naomi!
Me: 	(I should probably go find Eve.)
Me: 	(It's nearly lunchtime, after all.)
Me: 	Hmm... (I wonder what's for lunch today.)
Narr:	A rush of curiosity takes your concentration elsewhere for a moment.
Me: 	(I could also go around the back.)
Me: 	(Might be more interesting.)
Narr:	Your stomach grumbles impatiently.
Me: 	Okay, okay... (I should also grab a bite to eat.)
Me: 	(Either way, I should just pick a direction.)
        Me: 	(Either way, I should just pick a direction.)
Eve:	Hey, Dennis.
Eve:	How's your day going?
Me: 	It's been a pretty good day.
Eve:	I'm happy to hear that.
Eve:	Hey, Dennis...
Eve:	Can I talk to you about something?
Me: 	Sure, Eve.
Me: 	What is it?
Eve:	Let's go outside and get some fresh air.
Me: 	Sure. Lead the way.
Eve:	Ah, nothing like a gentle summer breeze.
Me: 	You didn't bring me out here just to enjoy the breeze?
Me: 	Did you?
Eve:	No, no.
Eve:	I wanted to check in with you.
Me: 	(Is there an ulterior motive to this "chat?")
Me: 	I'm doing fine, Eve.
Eve:	Are you enjoying your time here?
Me: 	(She's really trying to bait me, isn't he?)
Me: 	Well, I'm having a good time working here.
Eve:	That's good to hear.
Eve:	I've been trying to make it go as smoothly as possible for you.
Me: 	I've noticed. Thanks for that, Eve.
Eve:	How are you feeling, Dennis?
Me: 	I'm feeling kinda hungry, to be honest.
Eve:	Oh, come on. You know what I meant.
Eve:	How are you... emotionally?
Me: 	I'm doing pretty well.
Eve:	I'm happy to hear that.
Eve:	You're not feeling too stressed out?
Me: 	I mean, I have more to do than past summers...
Me: 	But, no. I don't really feel all that stressed.
Eve:	Even with all the new responsibilities?
Me: 	Nope. Not really. 
Me: 	I'm actually pretty happy to be doing more hands-on work this summer.
Eve:	(Good. Then I think the time is right...)
Eve:	I have a question I've been wanting to ask you.
Me: 	Oh?
Eve:	I just want to preface this by saying I haven't decided anything yet.
Eve:	Okay?
Me: 	Yeah. Sure, Eve.
Eve:	Well... I've been dreaming of taking a summer off.
Eve:	But, there's nobody who can step in for me.
Me: 	Sounds like you'd like me to be that person.
Eve:	Only if you wanted to, of course.
Eve:	And, you would need further training.
Me: 	Yeah, I wouldn't like to dive right into it.
Eve:	Oh, no. Psychiatry isn't something one dives into.
Eve:	Therapy needs forethought to not damage the patients' already-fragile minds.
Me: 	Yeah, I understand the fragility of the patients' minds.
Me: 	I've seen that first-hand over the years...
Eve:	You've become something like my right-hand man, Dennis.
Eve:	So, I was thinking...
Eve:	I can train you more directly, if you'd like.
Me: 	Wow, Eve... I don't know what to say.
Eve:	Hopefully yes?
Me: 	I'd be honored.
Eve:	Wonderful!
Me: 	*Grumble* Oh.
Me: 	I forgot how hungry I was with all this apprenticeship talk happening..
Eve:	Now that you mention it, I'm famished as well.
Eve:	Good thing I have a stack of pre-made sandwiches waiting.
Me: 	Always sandwiches?
Eve:	Hell, sandwiches are simple.
Eve:	And tasty.
Me: 	You got that right.
Eve:	Come now, my apprentice.
Me: 	Apprentice. That has a nice ring to it.
Narr:	Upon entering the Community Area, you're surprised to see it empty.
Me: 	Huh.
Me: 	(I really thought I'd bump into someone here.)
Me: 	(Guess I have the place to myself for the moment.)
Narr:	As you scan the room, you notice something in your peripheral vision.
Me: 	(What's that on the coffee table?)
Me: 	Oh?
Me: 	A stray folder.
Me: 	(I wonder what juicy info you're hiding...)
Me: 	(What secrets do you hold, little folder?)
Me: 	(This looks like some kind of plan for the summer.)
Me: 	(It also looks like Eve's handwriting.)
Me: 	(What's this?)
Me: 	(The plan for this summer?)
Me: 	"Call Dennis to get him onboard as staff for the summer."
Me: 	(We can check that one off.)
Me: 	"Welcome patients, and assess the severity of their conditions."
Me: 	(That one can be checked off too, at this point.)
Me: 	"Determine appropriate therapy for each patient."
Me: 	(Check.)
Me: 	"Conduct prescribed therapies with patients."
Me: 	(Also check.)
Me: 	"If prescribed therapy does not prove effective, prescribe alternative."
Me: 	Hmm... (Check?)
Me: 	"Upon the successful rehabilitation of group 1..."
Me: 	"...a second group will be taken in to fill the rest of the summer."
Me: 	What?
Me: 	"...a second group will be taken in..."
Me: 	(Shit. I guess I mentally distanced myself from the reality...)
Me: 	(...that the girls won't be here all summer.)
Me: 	(That they're here for a reason.)
Me: 	(A new group...)
Me: 	Very interesting.
Me: 	(I guess only time will tell who shows up next.)
Me: 	(And what quirks they could have...)
Me: 	(The only thing I can be sure of is that my summer won't be boring.)
Me: 	*Stomach grumbles* (I think I should deal with that first.)
Me: 	(Hopefully Eve made some lunch.)
Me: 	(Everything else can wait.)
Me: 	Pretty good sandwiches, Eve.
Eve:	Thanks.
Eve:	I think I've perfected the art of the light lunch.
Me: 	*Chuckle* I do think some variety wouldn't hurt, though.
Eve:	Well, feel free to make lunch yourself, then.
Eve:	I would definitely appreciate the help.
Me: 	Who knows...
Me: 	*Chuckle* I might consider putting on my chef's hat sometime.
Eve:	For the time being, you might want to put your waiter vest on.
Me: 	Waiter vest?
Me: 	You never gave staff vests.
Eve:	I'm pulling your leg.
Eve:	Grab that tray of sandwiches for me, Dennis.
Eve:	The patients must be getting hungry by now.
Me: 	Well, we shouldn't leave the patients waiting, then.
Eve:	That's the attitude.
Eve:	After you.
Naomi:	Okay, you guys really need to step-up your cuisine...
Naomi:	I'm really getting sick of sandwiches.
Eve:	Oh? Our menu isn't diverse enough for you, Naomi?
Naomi:	I don't think you can consider the food you're offering here a menu.
Eve:	Well...
Eve:	Thank you for your feedback, Naomi.
Eve:	We'll take it into consideration.
Eve:	We aim to provide the best experience possible.
Naomi:	Well, you're not doing too shabby.
Naomi:	I have to give you that.
Eve:	Thank you, Naomi.
Belle:	Hey, Dennis. Eve's really making sure to use you to the fullest, huh?
Me: 	Oh, you didn't hear?
Me: 	I've been promoted to waiter.
Belle:	Dr. Eve?
Eve:	Yes, Belle?
Belle:	Do you have a bell I can ring to have Dennis do my bidding?
Eve:	*Chuckle* Unfortunately not, Belle.
Belle:	Such a shame.
Belle:	I guess I'll have to be your bell.
Me: 	What?
Belle:	*Giggle* Byeee.
Me: 	(There she is.)
Eve:	Ah, there she is.
Me: 	(She looks... different.)
Me: 	(I wonder what's on her mind.)
Eve:	Hi, Stacy.
Stacy:	Hi, Dr. Eve.
Eve:	How are you doing today?
Stacy:	Fine.
Eve:	You sure?
Stacy:	Yeah.
Me: 	Hey, Stacy.
Stacy:	Hey.
Me: 	What's up with Stacy?
Eve:	I was wondering the same thing...
Eve:	Hmm...
Eve:	Do you want to go check in with her?
Me: 	Me? Isn't that your job?
Eve:	I have a feeling she'll trust you more than me.
Eve:	She sees me as Dr. Eve. You're just Dennis to her.
Me: 	Yeah, you're on to something there.
Me: 	I'll go check in on her.
Eve:	If anything, she'll appreciate your concern.
Me: 	Yeah, you're probably right about that.
Me: 	I'll go talk to her.
Me: 	Hey, Stacy.
Stacy:	Oh, hi again.
Stacy:	To what do I owe the pleasure?
Me: 	I just wanted to check in with you.
Me: 	You seemed... down.
Stacy:	Oh, no. I'm fine.
Stacy:	You don't need to worry about me...
Me: 	Come on, Stacy...
Me: 	You don't need to be afraid to tell me how you're really feeling.
Stacy:	I... I don't know, Dennis.
    Stacy:	I... I don't know, Dennis.
        Stacy:	I know I can... But, this feels bigger than you.
            Stacy:	I know I can... But, this feels bigger than you.
                Me: 	Bigger than me? That's pretty rude... Like I couldn't understand?
                Stacy:	That's not what I meant, Dennis...
                    Stacy:	That's not what I meant, Dennis...
                        Me: 	It sure sounded like you were implying that I'm an idiot.
                        Stacy:	No, I was not. I was hoping you would understand.
                            Stacy:	No, I was not. I was hoping you would understand.
                                Me: 	You need to understand... I'm not attuned to these things.
                        Me: 	Yeah, you're right. I overreacted a little bit too quickly...
                        Stacy:	It's okay. I always knew you were a kindred spirit of flame.
                            Stacy:	It's okay. I always knew you were a kindred spirit of flame.
                                Me: 	As you are, too. You can talk to me, Stacy. Kindred to kindred.
                Stacy:	I... don't know. It feels like something fateful will happen.
                    Stacy:	I... don't know. It feels like something fateful will happen.
                        Me: 	Stacy, are you okay? Those are disturbing feelings to have.
                        Me: 	I think I understand. I've also had a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach all day.
        Stacy:	No... This feels as though it's beyond my scope of knowledge.
            Stacy:	No... This feels as though it's beyond my scope of knowledge.
                Stacy:	You think this feeling is an omen of something to come?
                    Stacy:	You think this feeling is an omen of something to come?
                        Me: 	Well, not exactly. I don't even know what's actually going on.
                        Me: 	I've also had an ominous feeling since the morning...
                Stacy:	I fear consulting the heavenly flame would not be enough.
                    Stacy:	I fear consulting the heavenly flame would not be enough.
                        Me: 	Are you sure? Doesn't the HPL know nearly everything?
                        Me: 	That's even more ominous. The feeling in the pit of my stomach just got a bit bigger.
Stacy:	Dennis...
Stacy:	I would rather not dwell on these feelings.
Me: 	I just wanted to help you, in some way...
Stacy:	Thank you, for that.
Stacy:	But, I think this is something I must overcome alone.
Me: 	(Shit, this didn't go the way I would have liked it to.)
Stacy:	Don't worry, my ashen prince.
Stacy:	I believe this will pass.
Stacy:	For now, this thought must be cast into the crucible of my mind.
Stacy:	Once it has been broken down to a more malleable form...
Stacy:	Then I can attempt to understand this feeling.
Me: 	I wish I could do something to help you.
Stacy:	I truly appreciate your kindness.
Stacy:	But, I just need some time to think on this.
Me: 	I get it.
Me: 	I'll leave you to it, then.
Me: 	Take care, Stacy.
Stacy:	I will.
Stacy:	Goodbye, Dennis.
Stacy:	Well... I think you might be able to help me, then.
Me: 	I'm hoping I can.
Stacy:	As am I...
Me: 	(I have a weird hunch...)
Me: 	Stacy, did you have a nightmare?
Stacy:	I... don't think so?
Stacy:	I can't remember much of last night.
Stacy:	So, I probably slept through the night.
    Me: 	(That can't be right...)
    Me: 	(Everything I heard around camp told another story.)
    Me: 	(So... All that commotion in the night must have been Stacy.)
Me: 	You sure about that?
Stacy:	Yeah... I think I would remember waking up.
Me: 	Yeah... You're right about that.
Me: 	(There's definitely something up with Stacy.)
Me: 	You know, I had a strange dream last night.
Stacy:	You did? In what way?
Me: 	Well, it seemed oddly coincidental.
Stacy:	Oh, then you also must be a magnet of fate.
Me: 	I don't know about that...
Stacy:	Well, what happened in your dream?
Me: 	It's becoming foggier and foggier as the day goes on.
Me: 	But, I do remember some core fragments of it, still.
Me: 	There was an eclipse, and the sky was red.
Stacy:	Oh...
Stacy:	*Whispers* The high omen.
Me: 	What was that?
Stacy:	Nothing, nothing.
Stacy:	What else happened in your dream?
Me: 	(Shit. I can't tell her she was in my dream...)
Me: 	(Who knows what that information would do to her mental state.)
Me: 	Well, I got lost in the forest.
Me: 	Then, it got dark and I woke up.
Stacy:	That's... very interesting, Dennis.
Me: 	I wouldn't think much of it normally.
Me: 	But, when I went downstairs this morning, I saw the weather report...
Me: 	And, they announced an eclipse will happen tomorrow.
Me: 	I thought that coincidence was a bit strange.
Stacy:	You're a prophet...
Me: 	I doubt it, Stacy.
Me: 	Eve said I must have heard or read about it somewhere.
Stacy:	I don't think so...
Me: 	It's okay, Stacy. I doubt it means anything.
Me: 	Really, coincidences do happen.
Stacy:	As do miracles or... or omens.
Me: 	What's wrong, Stacy?
Stacy:	I don't know... but, you telling me your dream...
Stacy:	It gave me the feeling that I'm forgetting something.
Stacy:	And, I don't know why.
Me: 	Oh, Stacy...
Me: 	Come on.
Me: 	Everything is going to be okay.
Stacy:	I hope so, Dennis.
Stacy:	For now, I need to think.
Stacy:	I need to meditate...
Me: 	Okay, Stacy. I'll leave you to it.
Me: 	Take care, Stacy.
Stacy:	You too, Dennis.
Me: 	(Stacy really seems on edge...)
Me: 	(Maybe I should report this to Eve.)
Me: 	(It would be the smartest thing to do.)
Me: 	(But, I should probably learn more about what's going on before I do.)
Me: 	*Inhale* (What to do...)
Narr:	You feel overburdened by the scope of your task for a brief moment.
Me: 	(Where should I go to find out more?)
Me: 	(Eenie, meenie, miny, moe?)
Me: 	(Just pick one already, Dennis!)
        Me: 	(Just pick one already, Dennis!)
            Me: 	(This summer heat is really getting to me...)
            Me: 	(The air's probably cooler inside the house.)
            Me: 	(Where should I go...?)
                    Me: 	(Where should I go...?)
            Me: 	(Why not the cabins?)
            Me: 	(There has to be something that I'm missing here...)
            Me: 	(The cabins would probably hold some answers.)
            Me: 	(But, which cabin should I check?)
            Me: 	(Eh, why not both?)
                    Me: 	(Just pick one already, Dennis!)
Narr:	Eve has always been a secretive person, so the curiosity gets the better of you.
Narr:	You carefully open the door, poking your head inside.
Me: 	(I shouldn't...)
Me: 	(Yolo...)
Me: 	(I wonder how they feel lying in this chair...)
Me: 	(Listening to Dr. Eve explore their deepest fears.)
Me: 	"Oh, Dr. Eve, I haven't been feeling so well these past few weeks."
Me: 	"Can you help me? You're my last hope."
Me: 	(It looks so clean. I guess it was for her apprentice.)
Me: 	(Maybe it's going to be mine soon.)
Me: 	(Is there anything in these drawers?)
Me: 	(Locked. Ehh.)
Me: 	(What a strange looking ball...)
Me: 	(It looks kinda devilish. Something Stacy would have in her room.)
Me: 	(Aha! Treasure awaits...)
Me: 	(Files. Are those...?)
Me: 	"Belle, Violet, Stacy."
Me: 	(Naomi's isn't here. Eve must have taken it, I guess...)
Me: 	(Belle...)
Me: 	(Violet...)
Me: 	(And lastly, Stacy...)
Me: 	(That was an interesting read.)
Me: 	(Better put it back where I found it...)
Me: 	(Are these...)
Me: 	(My first summer here...)
Me: 	(I remember seeing Eve in a dress and my mind going blank.)
Me: 	(She thought I was slow.)
Me: 	(It was scorching heat that day.)
Me: 	(I barely managed to fix that door, but Eve was impressed nevertheless.)
Me: 	(Was that the Paris trip she talked about?)
Me: 	(How come I haven't noticed this here before?)
Me: 	(It's nice to see Eve put some character into here.)
Narr:	Seeing nothing else of interest here, you decide to get some rest and head to your room.
Narr:	Spending time with so many people at once feels a bit overwhelming at the moment.
Narr:	You had a restless night, so some time alone would feel nice.
Me: 	(Ahh... My dream car.)
Me: 	(I hope one day I'll be able to afford it.)
Me: 	(City skylines. Breathtaking...)
    Me: 	(What did that note say?)
    Me: 	(Pretzel Dip.)
    Me: 	("Mustard Pretzel Dip.")
    Me: 	(That's strange...)
    Me: 	(Why would she have food recipes under a pillow?)
    Me: 	(What else did it say?)
    Me: 	(Aha! Spork.)
    Me: 	(Spoons? What the...)
    Me: 	(Maybe if I add...)
    Me: 	(Oooh! Now it makes sense!)
    Me: 	(Those are sexual positions...)
    Me: 	"The Spork position allows for plenty of eye contact while you bump and grind..."
    Me: 	"It also allows you to try a sexy Kama Sutra hack."
    Me: 	(Kama Sutra sounds fun. I should read it sometime...)
Me: 	(Sometimes I miss good ol' college fun...)
Me: 	(Saturday night, no chores...)
Me: 	(No guidelines to prevent me from sleeping with someone...)
Me: 	(Not that it stopped me now.)
Me: 	(I'm not sure if I want this summer break to finish sooner or if I'm starting to like working here...)
Me: 	(Especially now that I'll be doing actual therapy.)
Me: 	(I never thought I'd say it, but I'm actually looking forward to spending more time with the patients.)
Me: 	(We stuffed ourselves with those burgers.)
Me: 	(Eve is a mean chef.)
Me: 	(Later we all told embarrassing stories.)
Me: 	(Even Eve, which was a nice surprise.)
Me: 	(I pulled Emily into the water when she wasn't looking.)
Me: 	(She was furious.)
Me: 	(Everyone else got a good laugh.)
Me: 	(She's always telling jokes.)
Me: 	(She's super sweet.)
Me: 	(That was the time we...)
Me: 	(...hooked up for the first time.)
Me: 	(And that was Eve mad we made a mess one night she wasn't there.)
Narr:	Fatigue overcomes you, and you decide to get some rest.
Me: 	(I haven't talked to Kiara since this morning...)
Me: 	Kiara?
Narr:	Getting no response, you step into her room.
Me: 	(No one's here...)
Me: 	(She left her phone here...)
Me: 	(Who has she been talking to?)
Me: 	(Michelle's her best friend.)
Me: 	(Of course she'd tell her.)
Me: 	(I wonder if there's anything juicy on her phone...)
Narr:	You stop for a moment and look around to make sure Kiara hasn't snuck in...
Narr:	Before continuing to check out Kiara's selfies.
Me: 	(Ooh! Jackpot!)
Me: 	(Damn! These are hot!)
Me: 	(Holy shit!)
Me: 	(Her legs are remarkable.)
Me: 	(I wouldn't mind sliding in there...)
Narr:	You're quite aroused by Kiara's nudes and you feel a hard-on coming.)
Me: 	(This is...)
Me: 	(...unexpected, but very welcome.)
Narr:	You're momentarily speechless and just enjoy the view of Kiara's silky smooth body.
Me: 	(I'm pushing my luck here. Better head back to my room.)
Me: 	Naomi? Violet?
Me: 	Huh... I guess they're out and about.
Me: 	I could take a peek or two...
    Me: 	(Oh, that must be the phantom from her story!)
    Me: 	(That's not such a bad drawing...)
    Me: 	(I guess she has more talents she keeps to herself.)
    Me: 	(Hmm... What's this supposed to be?)
    Me: 	(Some strange creature lurking in a lake?)
    Me: 	(Hopefully not our lake. Hector was enough.)
    Me: 	(I don't want another horrific story imprinted on my brain.)
Me: 	(A diary? Looks too small for that.)
Me: 	(Nope. Definitely not a diary.)
Me: 	("Hector's Abominations")
Me: 	("The Old Witch")
Me: 	(I guess these are the stories Naomi's working on.)
Me: 	(They sound very ominous...)
Me: 	(Let's put this back. Hopefully I'll get to hear some of these eventually.)
Me: 	("The Winner's Mind")
Violet:	I'm pretty sure snooping around patients' cabins goes against The Guidelines.
Me: 	I came looking for you, but you weren't around...
Me: 	So, I figured I'd wait here.
Violet:	Oh? Missed me?
Me: 	Maybe...
Violet:	After I stopped training, this book saved me.
Me: 	Really?
Violet:	Yeah. It helped me approach matters of mind and body differently.
Me: 	Good to know. I'm glad.
Violet:	Up for round two?
Me: 	Huh?
Violet:	Swimming contest.
Me: 	Oh! I'd love to, but...
Me: 	The first one drained all my energy.
Violet:	You don't want to lose, huh?
Me: 	You got me.
Violet:	What did you need?
Me: 	I was walking around, so I just wanted to say hi.
Violet:	Still tired?
Me: 	Yeah, it's been a long morning.
Violet:	You can lie down here if you want.
Me: 	Nah, I'll go back to my room. Maybe nap a bit.
Me: 	Freshen up and join you ladies afterwards.
Violet:	Can't wait! Sleep tight, Dennis!
Me: 	Thank you! See you later. Bye!
Violet:	Bye!
Me: 	(Probably smartest to check Stacy and Belle's cabin.)
Me: 	(I'll definitely find something helpful in there.)
Me: 	(If not, then I really don't know what to do.)
Me: 	Helloooo?
Me: 	Anyone home?
Me: 	(Doesn't look like it.)
Me: 	(Guess I have some time while the ladies are out.)
Me: 	(Looks like I have my work cut out for me.)
Me: 	(But, where to begin?)
    Me: 	(But, where to begin?)
        Me: 	(There's nothing really out of the ordinary with Belle's things.)
        Me: 	Hmm. (She even made her bed.)
        Me: 	(What did I expect?)
        Me: 	(The only interesting things Belle has at camp are her friends.)
        Me: 	(The only other thing here is her suitcase...)
        Me: 	(I'd say it's my duty as a member of the staff to check it out.)
        Me: 	(She did bring contraband to camp, after all.)
        Me: 	(Just a quick look...)
        Me: 	(Oh, she hasn't worn this outfit yet.)
        Me: 	(Looks like she's been holding out on us...)
        Me: 	(Or, saving it for a special occasion?)
        Me: 	(Okay, okay...)
        Me: 	(I think it's time I stopped.)
        Me: 	(I've really seen enough.)
        Me: 	(And learned nothing new.)
        Me: 	(Stacy's side has to be hiding some answers.)
        Me: 	Damn... (What the hell happened here?)
        Me: 	(It looks like a tornado tore through Stacy's side of the room.)
        Me: 	(Unless... Stacy was the tornado.)
        Me: 	(But, why would Stacy do this?)
        Me: 	(She's never acted destructively...)
        Me: 	(Even her obsession with fire was misunderstood.)
        Me: 	(She's a peaceful person.)
        Me: 	(Something is definitely wrong here.)
        Me: 	(What's that on her nightstand?)
        Me: 	*Sigh*
        Me: 	(Better get started).
        Me: 	What should I focus on?
            Me: 	What should I focus on?
                Me: 	(Stacy really made a mess of her side of the room...)
                Me: 	(I know some people are just naturally messy,)
                Me: 	(But Stacy's side of the room hasn't looked like this since she arrived.)
                Me: 	(She never seemed like a girl who wouldn't clean up after herself.)
                Me: 	(Nothing under here...)
                Me: 	(But, I already knew that. She didn't have much with her when she got here.)
                Me: 	(What's all of this?)
                Me: 	(Stacy spends her free time doodling?)
                Me: 	(I doubt it...)
                Me: 	(Especially given the subject material.)
                Me: 	(I don't know what any of this means.)
                Me: 	*Sigh* (Maybe it means nothing.)
                Me: 	(Maybe she really did just decide to pass some time drawing.)
                Me: 	(It could be some kind of personal religious ritual?)
                Me: 	(And, if that's the case than this may be totally ordinary...)
                Me: 	(As ordinary as possible for Stacy, at least.)
                Narr:	As you consider the intricacies of Stacy's religious rituals...
                Narr:	Something catches your attention in your peripheral vision.
                Me: 	(What's that?)
                Me: 	(Looks like a piece of paper.)
                Me: 	(Could be a tissue, or something.)
                Me: 	(But, better to check... right?)
                    Me: 	(But, better to check... right?)
                        Me: 	(It's probably nothing more than another doodle.)
                        Me: 	(None of this makes any sense, anyway.)
                        Me: 	(I'd just fall further down the rabbit hole.)
                        Me: 	*Chuckle* (As if I haven't already.)
                        Me: 	(It is my duty to make sure the cabins are clean and tidy.)
                        Me: 	(Well, side-duty.)
                        Me: 	(So, pillow... what secrets are you hiding?)
                        Narr:	The anticipation in the air is beginning to make you giddy.
                        Me: 	(Oooohhh...)
                        Me: 	(What's this?)
                        Me: 	(A ring?)
                        Me: 	(Is Stacy looking to lock-down her fiery prince?)
                        Me: 	(Oh shit.)
                        Me: 	(No, she couldn't be thinking of me...)
                        Me: 	(We barely know each other.)
                        Me: 	(Would she really get this attached so quickly?)
                        Me: 	Hmm...
                        Me: 	(This looks kinda familiar...)
                        Me: 	*Gasp* (It's an eclipse.)
                        Me: 	(Is that why she's been acting so weird?)
                        Me: 	(But, how does she know about the eclipse?)
                        Me: 	(Maybe she can read the stars.)
                        Me: 	*Chuckle* (Yeah right. She isn't some ancient mariner.)
                        Me: 	(She isn't an oracle, either.)
                        Me: 	Hmm...
                        Me: 	(Then, someone probably told her ahead of time.)
                        Me: 	(Or, she heard about it somewhere else and forgot. Like I probably did.)
                        Me: 	(This is pretty coincidental, though.)
                        Me: 	(Better keep this with me, it could come in handy.)
                        Me: 	(It's proof that something's a little off with Stacy.)
                        Me: 	(Well...)
                        Me: 	(I think all my detective training this week has paid off.)
                        Me: 	(My job here is done.)
Me: 	*Yawn* (I've been here a pretty long time.)
Me: 	(I should head back to the house...)
Me: 	(Maybe take a little nap.)
Me: 	(That sounds pretty nice...)
Me: 	(What a day...)
Me: 	(What a summer.)
Me: 	*Yawn* (I could use a good nap.)
Me: 	(Better set an alarm so I don't sleep through the day.)
Me: 	Hmm... (Let's say... two hours?)
Me: 	(An hour and a half?)
Me: 	(Yeah, that seems short enough.)
Me: 	*Yawn* (And... still long enough to recharge...)
Me: 	(...my batteries.)
