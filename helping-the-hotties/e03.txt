n "You sit on the bed and check the clock..."

m "(No, wait... Someone would have woken me up for sure.)"
m "(It must be broken...)"
m "Weird..."
n "Somewhat nervous, you look at the door for a moment, wondering if anyone is about to burst in."
m "..."
m "I thought for a second... (Had a feeling Eve would pop out.)"
n "You get up from bed..."
n "And get dressed."
n "Thinking of breakfast, you walk out of the room..."

em "*Mumbles* Good morning, [m!t]."
m "Morning, Emily."
m "Sleep well?"
em "Mhmmm..."
m "*Chuckle* Convincing."
em "How was your night?"
m "I-Uhh... (Wait, could she know something?)"
m "I was in my room. (Better avoid mentioning ANYTHING.)"
m "You? (I'm not sure if she's testing me or just being sincere...)"
em "*Yawn* I fell asleep pretty early."
m "And you slept until now?"
em "Mhmm..."
m "I'm surprised Eve doesn't give you shit for it."
em "My beauty sleep is sacred."
em "She wouldn't {i}dare{/i}."
m "*Chuckle* Scary."
m "(Not sure why she needs that much beauty sleep in the first place... She's pretty cute already.)"
m "(Seriously, [m!t]? That's Emily, for fuck sake! Stop thinking that shit!)"
n "Not long after, you two are down in the kitchen..."
mo "Morning, soldier."

em "Morning."
mo "Oh, Emily? Even you're up."
mo "To what do we owe the pleasure?"
em "*Mumbles* Leave me alone."
mo "*Chuckle* Grumpy as always."

mo "Soon. As you can see, I'm whipping something up."
m "Take your time."
mo "Why, thank you, {i}\"boss\"{/i}."
m "You know what I meant..."
mo "No, care to elaborate?"
m "It's too early in the morning for me to come up with a clever comeback."
mo "*Chuckle* Nice try, nevertheless..."
mo "So, have you gotten comfortable being back?"
m "Hardly, but..."
m "Guess it's not as soul-sucking as I thought at first."
mo "Mhmm, you'll be sad once it's over, I know it."
m "*Scoff* We'll see."
mo "Here you go, guys, eat up."
em "Thanks."
mo "So? Got any plans for today?"
m "Wallow in boredom and Weltschmerz?"
mo "*Chuckle* Funny. I'm even surprised you know about that term, but..."
mo "I can do you one better."
m "I'm listening. (More chores, wonderful...)"
mo "How about helping us after breakfast?"
m "Sure. (And here we go again...)"
m "And, what about you?"
mo "I need to get the Community Area ready."
mo "You should talk to Kiara. She'll brief you."
m "Will do, Eve. (Just dandy...)"
mo "Thanks, see you guys later."

em "She gone?"

n "You notice Emily's eyes opening, smile widening, like flipping an internal \"On\" button."
em "Great, we can eat in peace!"
m "Wait, were you only pretending to be grumpy and sleepy?"
em "*Chuckles* Just sleepy."
m "Just to... Get her off your back?"
em "Maaaybee..."
m "Something wrong?"
em "It's fine, I just don't feel like talking to her."
m "Why is that?"
em "I can't stand her making fun of me all the time."
em "Like I'm a child or stupid or something..."
m "She's just teasing you like she teases everyone."
m "You know how she is."
em "Yeah, {i}obnoxious{/i}."
m "That's not a very nice thing to say."
m "She even made you breakfast..."
em "Why are you busting my chops?"
em "Wanna get on my \"morning blacklist\" as well?"
m "*Sigh* No, I don't. (Eve would flip if she heard Emily talking like this.)"
m "So, had fun recently?"
m "You know, parties, friends, that sort of thing?"
em "Yeah, last weekend!"
em "Me and a few friends got together and got absolutely smashed, haha!"
em "We drank, like, a whole bunch of everything."
em "*Chuckle* I can hardly remember what happened after 10 PM. "
em "Everyone was all over the floor, lying in a puddle of broken glass and filth..."
m "You call that fun? (Does she think she'll impress me with this?)"
em "Yeah, what's wrong with letting yourself go from time to time?"
m "Sounds like a horrible way to spend your youth... or treat your body."
m "I'm not sure if these {i}\"friends\"{/i} of yours are a good influence."
em "Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Eve left, and I'm talking to [m!t]..."

em "It's so difficult to tell you two apart. (Why is he trying to school me?)"
m "Now you're just trying to be mean."
em "*Scoffs* Like you never partied before, {i}hypocrite{/i}..."
m "*Sigh* I'm done eating. (Can't talk to her when she gets like this.)"
em "Already? But you haven't finished your plate."
m "I lost my appetite. See ya' later."
n "You leave Emily in the kitchen to deal with her thoughts..."
n "Unbeknownst to you, she's more troubled by your words than you think."
n "Before you exit the house, Kiara calls out to you."
k "Where are you going?"
m "Huh?"
m "Oh, it's you... I was just about to go looking for you."
k "Yet I had to find {i}you{/i}."

k "Round up the patients and bring them to the Community Area."
k "They'll have a short briefing and a private session with Eve."

    nao "\"Curiosity,\" huh? Which means you're interested."
    m "Well, it's also getting out of hand."

    n "With one arm, you block Naomi's puny crotch-grab attack."
    m "That's not what I meant..."
    n "And with the other, you gently push her away."
    n "Without saying another word, Naomi passes you by, as if you're not worth her time..."

    m "(Now I'm curious. Maybe I could find out something more about her...)"
        m "(Guess I should go to the Community Area...)"
        m "(Guess I should go find the rest of them...)"
m "Hey, Violet."
v "Morning, [m!t]. Sleep well?"
m "Like a log. You?"
v "Not bad. Naomi helped."
m "Huh?"
m "She tucked you in and read bedtime stories?"
v "Haha, that sounds as lovely as breaking a foot..."
v "No, we argued for about two hours before getting exhausted."
m "Yup, that sounds legit."
v "And then we just fell asleep. *Chuckle*"
m "What was it about?"
v "Oh, you know... Girl stuff."
m "Mhm... Very vague."
    v "Wouldn't you rather train with me instead of talking about Naomi?"
    v "You were doing so well yesterday."
    v "It's boring subject anyway..."
    v "Though I did want to ask if you changed your mind about yoga."
    v "Interested in trying it with me this time?"
    n "Do yoga with Violet?"
        m "Sure, I don't see why not."
        n "Violet hands you one of her dumbbells."
            m "Yeah... And let's pretend I didn't fall on you last time."
            v "*Chuckle* It'll be better, this time around."
            m "Hope so. (\"Better\" how? \"Accidently\" getting a blowjob?)"
            m "Sorry about not having time yesterday."
            v "Don't worry, you can make it up to me today. *Chuckle*"
            m "Yeah, I {i}might{/i}. (It's curious how she’s more confident when training is involved.)"
        m "So, {i}Naomi{/i}..."
        v "Just can't let it go, can you?"
        m "What's up with you two?"
        m "I know she's a handful."
        m "Why do you guys fight? You meet before, or something?"
        v "I'm not sure, honestly. We met recently."
        m "So you just got off on the wrong foot?"
        v "Maybe, but it was like that the moment we saw each other."
        v "There's something about her..."
        v "The way she behaves..."
        v "The way she walks and talks, and..."
        v "The way she {i}looks{/i}..."
        m "(Looks?)"
        v "It just makes me so..."
        m "Uhhhh, I see, I see... (Damn! She really can't stand Naomi.)"
        v "Yoga helps, though."
        m "Definitely continue doing yoga, then. (Better not get on her bad side, if she’s strong as she is fit...)"
        v "Did you just come here to do yoga and talk about Naomi, or was there something else?"
        m "Oh, right! I completely forgot..."
        m "We're holding a briefing in the Community Area."
        m "All of you have to attend."
        v "Sure, Il'll be on my way."
        n "Somewhat unexpectedly, and without saying a word, Violet leaves to get ready for the briefing."
        n "If you didn't know any better, you might assume she had military training."
        m "(So obedient. Probably because of all the drilling so far.)"
        m "(I wonder what she's like in bed...)"

        m "*Chuckle* (Just imagine dominating that chiseled marble ass of hers...)"
        m "(Okay, maybe don't. I can feel an erection coming.)"
        m "Think I'll pass. I have more work to do."
        v "You should really get your blood flowing, but... Suit yourself."
        n "Violet continues to focus on her training..."
        n "Giving you ample opportunity to check her out."
        m "(Just look at that butt, so plump.)"
        m "(And those legs...)"
        v "Something on your mind?"
        m "Oh--Uhhh, I just noticed how well-built you are."
        v "Really, you mean it?"
        m "Are you kidding me? Have you {i}seen{/i} yourself?"
        m "You're like an Amazon in her prime."
        m "And even though you train a lot, you're still very feminine..."
        m "Very curvy..."
        m "Umm..."
        v "*Chuckle* Wow, thanks. (That was unexpected.)"
        m "Ah, fuck! Sorry... (Think before you talk! THINK!)"
        m "I got carried away."
        n "Violet shakes her head with a smile."
        v "Don't be. It feels really nice hearing someone say that..."
        v "While {i}\"thoroughly\"{/i} noticing me."
        m "Uhhh, right... No problem."
        m "Anyway, there's a briefing in the Community Area."
        m "You should attend when you're done."
        v "Just about done anyway."
        m "Great. I'll see ya'..."
        v "[m!ct]?"
        m "Yeah?"

    m "Hey! Snap out of it. (What the hell is wrong with her!? She was fine yesterday!)"
    s "Quick eyedrops underneath my fingernails..."

nao "Fucking bitch, I'll never forgive her."
m "I still don't see what that has to do with Violet or Belle. (Her mom sounds like some high-end prostitute...)"

b "\"BRB\"!"

b "*Wink*"
m "*Shivers* Oh God..."
s "Violet, have some."
v "Hmm... Guess I could take a sip."
m "\"Et tu, Brute\"?"

nao "We're not best buddies... but I guess I can respect her."

v "Want some?"
m "I mean, if Violet's drinking, I guess I don't have an excuse not to."
b "Woooo! GO, [m!tu]!"
s "Best guardian ever!"
v "*Chuckle* {i}Most handsome{/i} guardian."
nao "And the size of his... Oof! *Shivers*"
m "Good thing I didn't confiscate that bottle, I’m not sure how I'd handle you girls otherwise."
b "*Chuckle* Aww, [m!ct] likes us."
m "I'm sorry, did you mishear me?"
svi "Hahahaha!"
n "The booze lifts everyone's spirits, naturally."
n "And, after a while, everyone's nice and cozy..."
n "{i}And tipsy{/i}..."
m "So, anyone have any good campfire stories they wanna share?"
m "Violet, I'm sure you have some stories to share."
v "I don't know..."
b "Shyness is a sickness, you know?"
nao "And hyper-eroticism isn't?"
b "*Chuckle* Touché."
n "Violet is still gazing at the stars, wondering which story to tell..."
v "I think I have one, but it's not {i}that{/i} special."
nao "Whatever, just entertain us."
v "Okay, here goes nothing..."
v "Everyone's aware I've been into sports since I was a kid, right?"
v "My dad was a triathlete... a gold medalist might I add."
v "He wanted me to follow in his footsteps..."
nao "Classic pushy parent?"
v "Not really. I mean, he {i}is{/i} pushy..."
v "Anyway, my second trainer was this really nice guy, pretty famous too."
v "He helped me out with everything."
v "Making sure I'm healthy, and strong..."
v "Preparing me for competitions, and even training me outside working hours."
nao "Was he handsome?"
v "He was quite good-looking. Very charming, too."
b "{i}Drool{/i}."
v "*Chuckle* {i}A bit{/i}."
v "Everyone was quite infatuated with him, even my parents."
m "I hear a \"but\" coming..."
v "But..."
m "Called it."
v "Slowly, his affection started turning sour."
v "I knew he found me attractive, but I didn't think he'd make a move."
v "I was so young..."
b "How old were you back then?"
v "It was just after I turned eighteen."
b "Tell us more!"
v "He started touching me more often, even though I told him it felt weird."
v "He'd always pull back as soon as I said anything."
v "But one day, in the lockers, {i}he didn't{/i}..."
v "He kept flirting with me, trying to get me to say yes..."
v "But I wouldn't let up."
v "He continued anyway."
nao "Fuck, Violet, you got raped!?"
v "Oh, no, no."
s "What happened?"
v "I couldn't take it anymore, so I..."
v "Hit him."
m "And what did he do?"
v "Honestly, I don't remember."
v "I was seeing red, so everything is a bit blurry."
v "But after all was said and done..."
v "He ended up in the hospital with a broken arm."
v "Aaand his nose..."
v "Aaaaaand a few cracked ribs..."
v "They also had to buy new lockers."
nao "Holy shit..."
m "*Chuckle* Violet, you're pretty badass."
b "Nice, Violet!"
s "Remind me to never make you angry. I don’t really need to go through a full facial reconstruction."
v "*Chuckle* Thanks, guys."
v "*Blush* Everyone else scolded me afterwards."
v "Like, I was the one who went overboard."
m "He should count himself lucky that he's alive."
v "That's what I thought."
nao "Wow, sorry for giving you so much shit, Violet."
v "It's okay, apology accepted."
b "*Chuckle* Naomi is just scared for her life."
nao "Shut up."
m "Belle, why don't you tell us a story?"
b "Me? You sure?"
b "'Kay, you asked for it..."
b "So..."
b "At one point in my life, I met this older, gorgeous, woman."
b "Married, I might add."
m "Oh God, I think I know where this is going..."
b "We weren't close or anything... We didn't even know each other that long."
b "And, at one point, we found ourselves in a room together, just the two of us, alone..."
b "She was helping me out with something."
b "And we talked about this and that..."
b "I gave her a few compliments, and she found them very flattering."
b "She told me I was pretty..."
b "So I continued my advances."
m "And what? You had sex?"
v "Shhh! She was just getting to the good part..."
s "Continue."
n "Everyone feels a hot tingling sensation, listening to Belle's story..."
n "And the further the story goes, the more focused everyone is."
b "I began caressing her shoulder, and continued flirting with her."
b "At first she was chuckling, like I was making it all up..."
b "Said she wasn't interested."
b "But I was tenacious. I wanted her, {i}so badly{/i}."
b "So, there was only one thing I could do at this point..."
b "I kissed her on the lips."
v "Were they soft? (Wait, why did I ask that? Everyone's going to think I'm weird now, for sure!)"
b "Oooh, you have no idea."
b "At first, she looked shocked..."
b "But after a moment, she kissed me back."
s "Was there a fire near you?"
b "What? Fire? Why wou--"
b "*Sigh* {i}Never mind{/i}."
b "No, there was no fire."
b "Anyway, one thing led to the next, and soon..."
b "I was sticking my tongue in her mouth, and grabbing her tits."
b "She had these massive boobs you just wanted to drown yourself in."
b "So bubbly and soft..."
nao "Yeah, yeah, perfect tits. Now get to the good part."
b "She had this lovely dress, tight-fit."
b "It made her curves look extra sensual..."
m "And?"
b "[m!ct]? Is that you showing interest?"
m "It's the vodka."
b "*Chuckle* {i}If you say so{/i}."
b "So, the next thing..."
b "I slipped my hand under her skirt..."
b "And she let out the most erotic moan I've ever heard."
s "Would've been even better if there was a fire next to you, just saying..."
v "Stacy, shh!"
v "What happened next?"
m "(Wow, Violet's really into it, too.)"
b "I continued twisting my tongue around inside her mouth, while gently playing with her down there..."
b "Wanted to kiss and taste every inch of her body."
b "She looked as if she felt the same."
b "I was thinking how I wanted to lick her pussy clean and stick a dildo into all of her orifices."
v "AND THEN?"
b "*Sigh* Unfortunately, it was cut short."
v "Damn!"
nao "As expected. (Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at least {i}a little{/i} fun to listen to...)"
s "Told ya'. If you had a flickering flame near you, good fortune would have followed."
b "I know, right? Super anticlimactic."
b "She had to be somewhere and couldn't risk getting caught."
nao "Shame, she sounds lovely."
b "She is... I'm in love."
b "But, don't worry. I'll get into her pants eventually..."
m "Why am I not surprised?"
s "Just light a fire next time before you start seducing her, trust me."
v "If Belle's open-minded enough to try it with an older woman, she should."
nao "I can't believe I'm saying this... but I'm actually a little jealous."
m "I think we all are. *Chuckle*"
s "Any other stories? Preferably involving fire, this time."
m "Why don't you tell us a \"fiery\" story then, Stacy?"
s "Sure, I have a few."
s "What kind of tale would you like to hear?"
v "Do you have any stories, or legends about your religion? I've never heard anything about it."
s "Of course! Hundreds!"
nao "\"Hundreds\"? Seriously?"
s "Well, yeah. It's good practice..."
s "It's also the best way to get the youth interested."
s "I guess since you're all Seed-level, I'll start with our creation story..."
nao "\"Seed-Level\"?"
m "I think she's calling us uninformed idiots."
nao "Huh, annoying..."
s "Don't worry, the moment you hear our creation story, you'll be leagues ahead of the rest of the world."
b "Enough intro! I wanna hear what it's all about already."
n "Stacy stands up and takes a deep breath..."
s "In the beginning, there was only the void. Dark, and cold."
s "Endless, indifferent space..."
s "Apeiron!"
s "But this wouldn't last, at least {i}not forever{/i}."
s "The void, {i}Apeiron{/i}, at one point, became conscious..."
s "And this consciousness was like a baby, a different entity."
m "Heavenly-Phoenix Lotus?"
s "You're rushing the story, [m!ct]..."
s "Just 'cause you know parts of it, doesn't mean you should spoil it for the rest."
n "Everyone slightly chuckles at her remark."
m "Sorry..."
s "Anyway, on the first \"day,\" if you can even call it a day..."
s "This new entity realized it was bored."
s "Just imagine an existence, submerged in eternal darkness."
v "That sounds horrible..."
s "It WAS horrible."
s "This entity was sick of being cold..."
s "So it imagined what it would be like to not be cold."
s "It imagined the opposite of darkness..."
s "Light!"
s "Redness, flickering and movement!"
s "It created its first spark..."
s "A spark that would eventually grow and spread, lighting up the universe we live in."
v "Awww, that sounds so poetic."
s "It is..."
s "Without heat, without light, without movement... {i}nothing{/i} can exist."
s "So, the entity grew, and built its first world..."
s "Dimension, if you will, for the science freaks among you."
m "Thanks..."
s "This was its {i}home{/i}."
s "The first of the worlds!"
b "What's it like there?"
s "It's divine. Always warm, always light..."
s "Cinders fly like birds..."
s "Flowers smell like flames."
nao "Sounds like Hell, if you ask me."
s "It's a place we followers strive to get to."
m "So, like, your version of Heaven?"
s "Yeah, I guess it's something like that."
b "What happened next?"
s "Well, {i}trouble{/i}, as you can imagine."
s "Darkness might not be conscious, but it still holds power over everything."
s "And it \"wants\" only one thing..."
s "To consume and snuff out everything else."
s "So, in order to fight for its existence, our flaming entity continued to grow and create worlds."
s "Every sun, every fire, every heartbeat is an extension of our Lord."
s "But fighting the void is almost certainly a lost cause."
s "You can't stop it, you can't run away from it..."
s "And, at one point, our Lord was extinguished by the darkness."
nao "So we're all destined to perish, and descend into cold nothingness? Even if you're a godlike being?"
s "Yes..."
v "I don't like the sound of that."
s "But, don't you see? {i}The entity revived{/i}."
s "It couldn't be snuffed out, because of one sole reason..."
s "It swore to itself, and to all creation..."
s "That it would protect us from the darkness."
s "Eternity wouldn't stop it."
s "And then, after three eons, as it rose from its ashes, it adorned itself in the colors of flames, and took up a name..."
s "\"The Heavenly-Phoenix Lotus\"!"
s "Pure will, incarnate, the unfettered desire to live!"
s "And, that's why, if you look deeply into yourself..."
s "You'll find the same will and desire {i}burning{/i} within each of us."
nao "Since we're its extension?"
s "Exactly."
b "Woooow..."
v "*Sniff* It's so bittersweet."
m "And what now? Today? In this era."
s "It's the same as always..."
s "Live with a burning will, or perish into cold nothingness..."
m "Huh, tough times..."
m "Aaanyway..."
m "Naomi? Everyone else told a story... You got any of your own?"
nao "Don't people usually tell horror stories around campfires?"
m "I guess so."
nao "So, how about a horror story, but one that actually happened?"
s "Yes, please!"
v "I'm already getting the shivers."
b "Try us."
nao "You have a phone, right?"
m "Yeah. What for?"
nao "Give it here."
m "*Scoff* No way, you'll snoop around my private life."
nao "Oh, please. Like I care about your girlfriend."
nao "Just give me the damn phone. You'll get it back, I promise."
m "I know I'll regret this..."
n "You lend Naomi your phone."
n "Taking it, she turns on the flash and points it up toward her chin..."
n "Making her face look sort of scary and warped."
nao "This is an old story my grandma used to tell me."
nao "In Wisconsin, when she was young, they lived on a farm..."
nao "Every day was full of work, but the days were rather tranquil."
nao "No murders, no robberies, {i}no nothing{/i}."
nao "The only troublesome character that lived in their area was a hunter by the name of Hector."
nao "Hector was what you'd call \"an asshole.\""
nao "He generally kept to himself, but sometimes he'd get in fights with other people."
nao "And, always for the same reason..."
s "Why did they fight?"
nao "Because of the drastic decline in the wildlife population ever since he arrived."
m "So, he killed for sport?"
nao "Correct!"
nao "You see, Hector was a pretty good hunter, but a pretty {i}horrible{/i} human being."
nao "He had... tendencies."
m "Yeah? What kind?"
nao "My grandma told me..."
nao "Sometimes, every few weeks or so, they'd hear the cries of beasts."
nao "Not cries like when animals want to fuck, or compete to see who'll fuck..."
nao "But unnatural, ear-piercing screams of agony that would keep you up all night."
nao "Like damned spirits, bound in perpetual torture..."
s "Hey! I already used that kind of metaphor!"
nao "You don't own the English language, Stacy..."
v "{i}That's horrible{/i}."
b "Well, it IS a horror story."
nao "The next morning, all was quiet."
nao "The hunter returned with his handful of meat."
nao "Pieces of deer, always cut to size, and always a small amount."
nao "Only, she said his meat tasted funny... "
nao "No pun intended."
nao "Then, one day, as she was playing around the forest with her friends..."
nao "They got a whiff of an inexplicable and unbearable stench."
s "Was it poo?"
nao "No, it was not poo! It was WORSE!"
v "*Gasp*"
s "What smells worse than poo?"
nao "How about a wretched mass of bloody, rotting, and unrecognizable corpses?"
v "Eww, I'm definitely going to puke."
nao "She said she saw hooves, antlers and rib cages."
nao "Crushed, and broken... All lumped together."
nao "It was scarring... Trully the stuff of nightmares."
nao "My grandma knew immediately..."
nao "She knew Hector was the one who did it. There was no doubt in her mind."
v "Please tell me this has a happy ending?"
nao "Hah. I'll make sure to describe the gore in extra detail, just for you."
v "*Sigh*"
nao "Anyway, she ran back home to tell her parents what she saw."
nao "They believed her, but by the time she told them everything, it was already dark."
nao "So, they decided to wait until morning."
nao "But, suddenly..."
nao "*Inhuman screech*"
v "EEEEEEEK!"
nao "The screams, they could hear the screams again."
nao "But... they were different, more shrill, {i}more horrible{/i} than ever before."
nao "Like hundreds of tortured voices screaming in agony."
nao "Followed by loud thuds, like steps. Trees started to fall..."
nao "And then..."
nao "Another voice was heard, a human voice."
nao "Which slowly morphed into this gurgling, howling scream, louder than ever before."
nao "My grandma was shaking like a leaf. Her parents tried calming her throughout the night..."
nao "Once morning came, they walked down to the trail to the hunter's cottage."
nao "My grandma led them to the pile of corpses, but when they got there..."
nao "There was nothing to be found."
nao "Just a trail of fallen trees and blood."
nao "You can guess where the trail led..."
m "Hector's cabin?"
nao "*Nod* At this point, grandma knew what happened even before they even got to his place."
nao "And once they did, well..."
b "What!? What happened!? (Why am I so interested in this gory story?)"
nao "The first thing they noticed was Hector's cabin, crushed as if a tree fell on it."
nao "But there was no tree trunk in sight."
nao "The next thing that caught their attention... were the scattered remains, reduced to a bloody mess."
s "Oh, no..."
nao "Oh, yes!"
nao "They were Hector's remains, scattered and strewn across the vicinity."
nao "His skull crushed in the dirt... his entrails hanging on nearby branches."
nao "A bit of Hector here, a bit of Hector there..."
nao "There was nothing to be done."
nao "He was gone, and so was his home."
nao "So, they collected all the bits and pieces of Hector that they could find, and set them ablaze, along with his cottage."
s "FIRE ONE, HECTOR ZERO!"
nao "*Clears throat*"
nao "And now, today..."
nao "Almost fifty years later... My grandma's blood still runs cold when she talks about it."
v "Horrible..."
b "But you haven't told us what happened with the pile of corpses."
m "It was probably eaten by wildlife or something."
nao "I told you, all the wildlife was nearly gone because of Hector."
nao "Nothing could've eaten a \"mound\" of flesh without letting anything go to waste."
nao "The worst part of this story is that they never found the corpses my grandma was looking for..."
nao "As soon as she was a bit older, she moved away from that place."
nao "Told me it gave her the creeps."
nao "Whatever it was that got Hector that night, it disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again."
v "*Shiver*"
b "That... was actually super creepy."
s "Naomi {i}is{/i} creepy..."
nao "I don't want to hear that from you!"
m "Not bad, but it's still just a story."
nao "I told you, {i}this happened{/i}."
m "Can I have my phone back?"
nao "Everything I told you is exactly how my grandma used to tell me."
m "Maybe she just wanted to scare you?"
nao "Maybe... But, {i}I think{/i}, that shambling horror is still out there."
nao "Punishing hunters that go too far..."
v "Guys, the fire is going out. Should we call it a night?"
nao "Fear of the dark?"
v "Don't be ridiculous..."
m "It's still pretty early, all we need is more wood."
m "Any volunteers?"
n "After a moment of silence..."
m "Thought so."
m "Then I'll go get some. Be right back."
nao "Wait, [m!ct]! That's how all horror stories begin! The protagonists split up!"
m "If I'm not back within fifteen minutes, consider me murdered by some weird, shambling abomination."
s "Sounds fair."
v "Shouldn't we go with him? It's pretty dark out."
b "It's {i}his{/i} backyard, he'll be fine."
nao "Maybe Hector pops up to hunt and torture him."
v "Oh, no..."
v "Be careful, [m!ct]!"
n "With that, you leave to get some more wood..."
m "(\"Be careful\"... Did she really buy Naomi's story?)"
m "(It's just a story... What's got them shaking in their boots so much?)"
m "..."
m "*Chuckle* (I mean, if it's a massive lump of rotting flesh that's after me, I could probably outrun it.)"
m "Ah! (Some more wood!)"
m "(Fuck, it really {i}is{/i} almost pitch black. I can barely see shit in front of me.)"
m "(What's making so much noise!?)"
m "Hello? Girls?"
m "..."
m "(Probably a squirrel or some shit.)"
m "*Chuckle* (I actually got scared there for a second.)"
m "(Naomi and her silly...)"
m "*Gasp* (WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!?)"
m "(I've never heard anything like it!)"
m "AAAH! FUUUUCK!!! (It's the monster!)"
m "(HECTOR'S ABOMINATION IS AFTER ME!)"
m "(Run, run, run! Just RUN!)"
m "(Holy shit, it's going to crush me!)"
m "(It's going to tear me apart!)"
m "(It's going to massacre me!)"
m "(Keep running, FASTER!)"
m "*Grunt* (Fucking branches, fucking darkness!)"
m "THERE! (The house! I can see the house!)"
m "(I can make it!)"
m "*Gasp* (It's right behind me!)"
m "(Just a bit furthe--)"
m "Ughhhhh..."
m "My head..."
m "(Where am I? It's so dark.)"
m "(Something's covering my eyes...)"
m "Huh? (I'm tied down!)"
m "(I was in the forest... Collecting wood, and...)"
m "(Something came after me.)"
m "(I ran, and... I don't remember!)"
m "(I thought that monster was gonna get me.)"
m "(But why am I tied down?)"
m "(Holy shit, was it Hector, the hunter?)"
m "AHHH! HECTOR!"
m "Stay away from me, you freak!"
m "If you hurt me, I'll hurt you! I SWEAR!"
m "I'm warning you!"
n "Suddenly, you feel a hand on your leg."
n "Scared shitless, you barely notice that the touch is gentle and warm..."
n "Definitely not the touch of an evil hunter, or his monster."
n "The hand caresses your leg."
n "It travels further up..."
n "Until it grabs your crotch."
n "And starts stroking you over your clothes."
n "Until it unbuckles your pants..."
n "And takes them off, leaving your manhood exposed."
noname "*Mmm...*"
m "(A woman?)"
m "(It must be one of the girls!)"
m "Ladies, you didn’t have to tie me up..."
n "A hand grabs your dick with determination."
n "And starts stroking..."
m "(One of them is jerking me off!?)"
m "I know you're cock-hungry, but this is just obsessive overkill."
m "I mean, I'm tied to a tree! There was no need for that."
n "As the hand continues jerking you off, your dick becomes rock-hard quite quickly."
m "*Pant* (Fuck... This feels pretty damn good.)"
m "Damn girl, you’re too good at this."
n "You can feel the grip tighten as the hand pumps your cock even harder."
m "*Groan* Fuck..."
m "Don't stop..."
n "Suddenly, you feel something else on your tip..."
m "(Is that... A tongue!?)"
m "Ahhh... (She's licking my cock!)"
m "(I can't believe this is happening... Am I dreaming?)"
m "What are you waiting for? Too scared to put it in your mouth?"
n "Taking up the challenge, a different sensation envelops your cock..."
n "The mouth sucks you off gingerly, as a tongue coils around you."
n "A pleasurable electricity shoots up through your body..."
m "(Oh, man... Whoever this is knows how to suck dick!)"
m "*Groan* You're making my mind melt..."
m "*Pant* Fuck, don't stop."
m "Just keep sucking my dick like that."
n "Your comments increase the enthusiasm of whoever was sliding your cock into their mouth..."
n "It continues... Every repetition going deeper than the last."
n "Pulling more of your length inside, each time..."
n "Faster, and faster..."
m "Fuck, I can barely hold it anymore."
m "*Grunt* You're gonna make me cum!"
n "You swear you can almost feel a smile on the mouth that's currently sucking you off as you say this..."
n "And, the mouth doesn't let up..."
n "This person wants every single drop of your hot cum inside their throat."
m "*Pant* I’m gonna cum in your mouth! Hnnngh..."
m "*Groan* Here it comes!"
n "Your dick contracts, shooting out its first stream of cum, right into the mouth enveloping it."
n "A second... then a third and a fourth..."
n "As you continue emptying your balls, the mouth keeps sucking you off, swallowing each load with dedication."
n "Their lips, tightly sealed around your cock..."
n "Their hand, gripping your shaft."
m "Oh, my God! You're too good at this..."
m "*Pant* You deserve an encore."
n "The lips that haven't said a word this entire time slide along your whole length..."
n "Reaching the tip and releasing it with a loud slurping sound."
n "At this point, your mind is almost completely blank. Unable to move, unable to see {i}anything{/i}..."
n "Finally, you hear footsteps and the rustling of leaves."
n "The person walks behind you and loosens the knots that held you down..."
n "Leaving before you gather your bearings, still enthralled by the experience."
n "You wiggle a little, freeing one of your arms."
m "*Sigh* I can finally remove this blindfold."
m "(What was that!?)"
m "(And who was that...)"
