Me: 	*Mumbles* Whazza... Huh? Where am I?
Me: 	(Why am I so drowsy and disoriented? What the fuck happened yesterday?)
Me: 	*Yawn*
Me: 	Good morning, beautiful world. (What horrors do you have in store for me today?)
Narr:	You sit on the bed and check the clock...
Me: 	12 PM?! I-Impossible! (I slept that long?!)
Me: 	(No, wait... Someone would have woken me up for sure.)
Me: 	(It must be broken...)
Me: 	Weird...
Narr:	Somewhat nervous, you look at the door for a moment, wondering if anyone is about to burst in.
Me: 	...
Me: 	I thought for a second... (Had a feeling Eve would pop out.)
Narr:	You get up from bed...
Narr:	And get dressed.
Narr:	Thinking of breakfast, you walk out of the room...
Narr:	The moment you exit the room, you bump into Emily, who also just woke up.
Emily:	*Mumbles* Good morning, [m!t].
Me: 	Morning, Emily.
Me: 	Sleep well?
Emily:	Mhmmm...
Me: 	*Chuckle* Convincing.
Emily:	How was your night?
Me: 	I-Uhh... (Wait, could she know something?)
Me: 	I was in my room. (Better avoid mentioning ANYTHING.)
Me: 	You? (I'm not sure if she's testing me or just being sincere...)
Emily:	*Yawn* I fell asleep pretty early.
Me: 	And you slept until now?
Emily:	Mhmm...
Me: 	I'm surprised Eve doesn't give you shit for it.
Emily:	My beauty sleep is sacred.
Emily:	She wouldn't dare.
Me: 	*Chuckle* Scary.
Me: 	(Not sure why she needs that much beauty sleep in the first place... She's pretty cute already.)
Me: 	(Seriously, [m!t]? That's Emily, for fuck sake! Stop thinking that shit!)
Narr:	Not long after, you two are down in the kitchen...
Eve:	Morning, soldier.
Me: 	Hi, Eve. (Ah, there's my answer.)
Emily:	Morning.
Eve:	Oh, Emily? Even you're up.
Eve:	To what do we owe the pleasure?
Emily:	*Mumbles* Leave me alone.
Eve:	*Chuckle* Grumpy as always.
Me: 	Any breakfast?
Eve:	Soon. As you can see, I'm whipping something up.
Me: 	Take your time.
Eve:	Why, thank you, "boss".
Me: 	You know what I meant...
Eve:	No, care to elaborate?
Me: 	It's too early in the morning for me to come up with a clever comeback.
Eve:	*Chuckle* Nice try, nevertheless...
Eve:	So, have you gotten comfortable being back?
Me: 	Hardly, but...
Me: 	Guess it's not as soul-sucking as I thought at first.
Eve:	Mhmm, you'll be sad once it's over, I know it.
Me: 	*Scoff* We'll see.
Eve:	Here you go, guys, eat up.
Emily:	Thanks.
Eve:	So? Got any plans for today?
Me: 	Wallow in boredom and Weltschmerz?
Eve:	*Chuckle* Funny. I'm even surprised you know about that term, but...
Eve:	I can do you one better.
Me: 	I'm listening. (More chores, wonderful...)
Eve:	How about helping us after breakfast?
Me: 	Sure. (And here we go again...)
Me: 	And, what about you?
Eve:	I need to get the Community Area ready.
Eve:	You should talk to Kiara. She'll brief you.
Me: 	Will do, Eve. (Just dandy...)
Eve:	Thanks, see you guys later.
Narr:	Eve leaves the kitchen and the two of you alone.
Emily:	She gone?
Me: 	Umm, yeah?
Narr:	You notice Emily's eyes opening, smile widening, like flipping an internal "On" button.
Emily:	Great, we can eat in peace!
Me: 	Wait, were you only pretending to be grumpy and sleepy?
Emily:	*Chuckles* Just sleepy.
Me: 	Just to... Get her off your back?
Emily:	Maaaybee...
Me: 	Something wrong?
Emily:	It's fine, I just don't feel like talking to her.
Me: 	Why is that?
Emily:	I can't stand her making fun of me all the time.
Emily:	Like I'm a child or stupid or something...
Me: 	She's just teasing you like she teases everyone.
Me: 	You know how she is.
Emily:	Yeah, obnoxious.
Me: 	That's not a very nice thing to say.
Me: 	She even made you breakfast...
Emily:	Why are you busting my chops?
Emily:	Wanna get on my "morning blacklist" as well?
Me: 	*Sigh* No, I don't. (Eve would flip if she heard Emily talking like this.)
Me: 	So, had fun recently?
Me: 	You know, parties, friends, that sort of thing?
Emily:	Yeah, last weekend!
Emily:	Me and a few friends got together and got absolutely smashed, haha!
Emily:	We drank, like, a whole bunch of everything.
Emily:	*Chuckle* I can hardly remember what happened after 10 PM. 
Emily:	Everyone was all over the floor, lying in a puddle of broken glass and filth...
Me: 	You call that fun? (Does she think she'll impress me with this?)
Emily:	Yeah, what's wrong with letting yourself go from time to time?
Me: 	Sounds like a horrible way to spend your youth... or treat your body.
Me: 	I'm not sure if these "friends" of yours are a good influence.
Emily:	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Eve left, and I'm talking to [m!t]...
Emily:	Not the other way around.
Emily:	It's so difficult to tell you two apart. (Why is he trying to school me?)
Me: 	Now you're just trying to be mean.
Emily:	*Scoffs* Like you never partied before, hypocrite...
Me: 	*Sigh* I'm done eating. (Can't talk to her when she gets like this.)
Emily:	Already? But you haven't finished your plate.
Me: 	I lost my appetite. See ya' later.
Narr:	You leave Emily in the kitchen to deal with her thoughts...
Narr:	Unbeknownst to you, she's more troubled by your words than you think.
Narr:	Before you exit the house, Kiara calls out to you.
Kiara:	Where are you going?
Me: 	Huh?
Me: 	Oh, it's you... I was just about to go looking for you.
Kiara:	Yet I had to find you.
Me: 	Just tell me what needs doing.
Kiara:	Round up the patients and bring them to the Community Area.
Kiara:	They'll have a short briefing and a private session with Eve.
Me: 	Right.
Kiara:	Oh and, [m!t]? Try not to ogle the patients too much.
Me: 	*Inaudible swearing*
Narr:	With that, you leave the house...
    Narr:	After a knock...
    Naomi:	Come iiin!
    Me: 	(That's definitely Naomi. She sounds energetic...)
    Me: 	(Wonder what's up with h...)
    Naomi:	Hey, [m!t]. I've been expecting you.
    Me: 	HOLY FUCK!
    Naomi:	Like what you see?
    Naomi:	Better than a picture, right?
    Narr:	Quickly turning your head, you remain frozen in place.
    Me: 	Uhh...
    Naomi:	*Chuckle* Got your mind blown, huh?
    Me: 	What the hell are you doing naked and spread like some art model!?
    Naomi:	Waiting for you to "draw" me.
    Me: 	Well, I suck at art.
    Naomi:	Maybe you should take a closer look, then?
    Naomi:	Real life models are very, very useful for learning things like that.
    Me: 	Might be able to draw a stickman with boobs, but that's about it.
    Naomi:	Well, you can try again...
    Naomi:	And again...
    Naomi:	And again.
    Naomi:	Until you get it right...
    Naomi:	And then, we can take a large "canvas" out, and see what we end up making.
    Me: 	Maybe some other time.
    Naomi:	You know, it's not nice to keep a lady waiting.
    Me: 	... ("Lady"? HAH! You've been basically begging me to fuck you since yesterday.)
    Naomi:	Wow, you're like a stone wall, aren't you?
    Naomi:	You're actually making me feel unwanted now.
    Me: 	...
    Naomi:	*Sigh* At least tell me if they're any good.
    Narr:	You're barely able to keep yourself from looking.
    Narr:	Naomi's request made it impossible not to...
    Narr:	So, you take a peek.
        Narr:	So, you take a peek.
            Me: 	I guess they're okay.
            Naomi:	"OKAY"?! What do you mean "okay"!?
            Naomi:	Take another look, you blind idiot!
            Narr:	You check out her tits again...
            Naomi:	Just try telling me they're not amazing, I dare you.
            Me: 	Alright, fine!
            Me: 	They look amazing. Soft, yet firm...
            Me: 	Not too big, not too small...
            Me: 	Some might even say "perfect".
            Me: 	Happy?
            Naomi:	Mhm... Thought so.
            Naomi:	Glad you like them.
            Me: 	(Like I have a choice...)
            Naomi:	If you behave, I'll let you fondle them a bit.
            Me: 	("She is practically been begging me to fuck her since yesterday"...)
            Me: 	Get dressed, please. You have a meeting at the Community Area.
            Naomi:	Why didn't you say so sooner?
            Narr:	Naomi gets up and looks for her clothes.
            Me: 	I'll leave you to it.
            Narr:	She ignores you as she gets dressed.
            Me: 	*Sigh* (Always something with that chick...)
            Me: 	Nothing special.
            Naomi:	WHAT!?
            Me: 	Yeah, I've seen better.
            Naomi:	How can you say that!?
            Me: 	You're the one who asked for my opinion...
            Me: 	Now you know.
            Naomi:	Get out, GET OUT!
            Me: 	Going!
            Me: 	Oh, by the way...
            Me: 	There's a briefing at the Community Area you should attend.
            Naomi:	OUT!
            Narr:	As you leave the cabin, you close the door behind you.
            Me: 	*Chuckle* (I shouldn't enjoy pissing people off)...
            Me: 	...(but something about her rubs me the wrong way.)
        Me: 	(Guess I should go to the Community Area...)
        Me: 	(Guess I should go find the rest of them...)
    Narr:	After a knock...
    Naomi:	It's open!
    Narr:	Opening the door, you notice Naomi standing in the cabin.
    Narr:	Dressed and ready, looking quite stunning.
    Narr:	So much so, you're left speechless for a moment.
    Naomi:	Hello? Yes?
    Me: 	*Stare* Umm...
    Naomi:	Be careful with that look of yours...
    Naomi:	You'll make me blush...
    Naomi:	And horny.
    Me: 	Uhh... You're already dressed? (She's too close.)
    Naomi:	Of course, I must look dashing at all times.
    Naomi:	And your reaction tells me I'm doing a good job. (You're cracking, [m!ct]... I can feel it.)
    Me: 	Right, well, could you "look dashing" at the Community Area?
    Naomi:	Hmm? What for?
    Me: 	We're having a briefing.
    Naomi:	Oh, I see.
    Me: 	Naomi, can I ask you something?
    Naomi:	Anything...
    Me: 	Why do you keep hitting on me? What's your deal?
    Naomi:	Why do you want to know?
    Me: 	Curiosity?
    Naomi:	"Curiosity," huh? Which means you're interested.
    Me: 	Well, it's also getting out of hand.
    Naomi:	Then I'll just use my hand...
    Narr:	With one arm, you block Naomi's puny crotch-grab attack.
    Me: 	That's not what I meant...
    Narr:	And with the other, you gently push her away.
    Narr:	Without saying another word, Naomi passes you by, as if you're not worth her time...
    Narr:	Like some speck of filth, not even worthy of her attention...
    Narr:	She leaves you guessing...
    Narr:	Leaves you unaware that her plans are already in motion.
    Me: 	(What's up with her?)
    Me: 	(She keeps hitting on me... Does she just wanna provoke me or...)
    Me: 	(Last time we talked was so... weird. Over the top, and suspicious.)
    Me: 	(What if she's lying about the reason she's here?)
    Me: 	(Now I'm curious. Maybe I could find out something more about her...)
        Me: 	(Guess I should go to the Community Area...)
        Me: 	(Guess I should go find the rest of them...)
Me: 	Hey, Violet.
Violet:	Morning, [m!t]. Sleep well?
Me: 	Like a log. You?
Violet:	Not bad. Naomi helped.
Me: 	Huh?
Me: 	She tucked you in and read bedtime stories?
Violet:	Haha, that sounds as lovely as breaking a foot...
Violet:	No, we argued for about two hours before getting exhausted.
Me: 	Yup, that sounds legit.
Violet:	And then we just fell asleep. *Chuckle*
Me: 	What was it about?
Violet:	Oh, you know... Girl stuff.
Me: 	Mhm... Very vague.
    Violet:	Wouldn't you rather train with me instead of talking about Naomi?
    Violet:	You were doing so well yesterday.
    Violet:	It's boring subject anyway...
    Violet:	Though I did want to ask if you changed your mind about yoga.
    Violet:	Interested in trying it with me this time?
    Narr:	Do yoga with Violet?
        Me: 	Sure, I don't see why not.
        Narr:	Violet hands you one of her dumbbells.
            Me: 	Yeah... And let's pretend I didn't fall on you last time.
            Violet:	*Chuckle* It'll be better, this time around.
            Me: 	Hope so. ("Better" how? "Accidently" getting a blowjob?)
            Me: 	Sorry about not having time yesterday.
            Violet:	Don't worry, you can make it up to me today. *Chuckle*
            Me: 	Yeah, I might. (It's curious how she’s more confident when training is involved.)
        Me: 	So, Naomi...
        Violet:	Just can't let it go, can you?
        Me: 	What's up with you two?
        Me: 	I know she's a handful.
        Me: 	Why do you guys fight? You meet before, or something?
        Violet:	I'm not sure, honestly. We met recently.
        Me: 	So you just got off on the wrong foot?
        Violet:	Maybe, but it was like that the moment we saw each other.
        Violet:	There's something about her...
        Violet:	The way she behaves...
        Violet:	The way she walks and talks, and...
        Violet:	The way she looks...
        Me: 	(Looks?)
        Violet:	It just makes me so...
        Me: 	Uhhhh, I see, I see... (Damn! She really can't stand Naomi.)
        Violet:	Yoga helps, though.
        Me: 	Definitely continue doing yoga, then. (Better not get on her bad side, if she’s strong as she is fit...)
        Violet:	Did you just come here to do yoga and talk about Naomi, or was there something else?
        Me: 	Oh, right! I completely forgot...
        Me: 	We're holding a briefing in the Community Area.
        Me: 	All of you have to attend.
        Violet:	Sure, Il'll be on my way.
        Narr:	Somewhat unexpectedly, and without saying a word, Violet leaves to get ready for the briefing.
        Narr:	If you didn't know any better, you might assume she had military training.
        Me: 	(So obedient. Probably because of all the drilling so far.)
        Me: 	(I wonder what she's like in bed...)
        Me: 	("Drop those panties! Now lift up that butt!")
        Me: 	("Yes, sir! Of course, sir!")
        Me: 	*Chuckle* (Just imagine dominating that chiseled marble ass of hers...)
        Me: 	(Okay, maybe don't. I can feel an erection coming.)
        Me: 	Think I'll pass. I have more work to do.
        Violet:	You should really get your blood flowing, but... Suit yourself.
        Narr:	Violet continues to focus on her training...
        Narr:	Giving you ample opportunity to check her out.
        Me: 	(Just look at that butt, so plump.)
        Me: 	(And those legs...)
        Violet:	Something on your mind?
        Me: 	Oh--Uhhh, I just noticed how well-built you are.
        Violet:	Really, you mean it?
        Me: 	Are you kidding me? Have you seen yourself?
        Me: 	You're like an Amazon in her prime.
        Me: 	And even though you train a lot, you're still very feminine...
        Me: 	Very curvy...
        Me: 	Umm...
        Violet:	*Chuckle* Wow, thanks. (That was unexpected.)
        Me: 	Ah, fuck! Sorry... (Think before you talk! THINK!)
        Me: 	I got carried away.
        Narr:	Violet shakes her head with a smile.
        Violet:	Don't be. It feels really nice hearing someone say that...
        Violet:	While "thoroughly" noticing me.
        Me: 	Uhhh, right... No problem.
        Me: 	Anyway, there's a briefing in the Community Area.
        Me: 	You should attend when you're done.
        Violet:	Just about done anyway.
        Me: 	Great. I'll see ya'...
        Violet:	[m!ct]?
        Me: 	Yeah?
        Violet:	Thanks for the compliments, and...
        Violet:	You're not bad yourself.
        Narr:	Saying this, Violet leaves to get ready.
        Narr:	Empty headed and smitten, it takes a few moments for you to come back to reality.
        Me: 	(Damn, what a bombshell...)
        Me: 	(I'm surprised I haven't gotten an erection already.)
    Me: 	(Guess I should go to the Community Area now...)
    Me: 	(Guess I should go find the rest of them now...)
    Me: 	(Let's check on Stacy and Belle.)
    Narr:	Approaching their cabin door, you knock.
    Narr:	Nobody answers, so you decide to enter anyway...
    Narr:	As you enter, the first thing you notice is Belle still tucked into her bed.
    Narr:	Sleeping soundly as an angel...
    Me: 	(Where's Stacy?)
    Me: 	(Did she leave already?)
    Narr:	As you look around, you spot a dark shape in the corner of the room.
    Me: 	(What's that?)
    Narr:	It takes you a few seconds to realize what it is you're looking at...
    Me: 	Stacy?
    Stacy:	*Inaudible mumbling*
    Me: 	What are you doing in that corner?
    Stacy:	When crickets mate, they put canvases on their doors and...
    Me: 	Stacy? What's wrong? Are you hurt?
    Stacy:	Sometimes they see me, but sometimes roses grow out from their postcards...
    Me: 	Hey! Snap out of it. (What the hell is wrong with her!? She was fine yesterday!)
    Stacy:	Quick eyedrops underneath my fingernails...
    Me: 	(Yesterday? Is it because I took her lighters?)
    Stacy:	When do fireflies hope for bone dust?
    Me: 	Ahh, shit... (She said she needed it to "commune with the spirits" or some crap like that.)
    Me: 	Alright, Stacy. Come on, get up.
    Stacy:	The lighthouse has a meteor in it...
    Me: 	Let's get you outside...
    Stacy:	But the glass is blue, I can't become blue!
    Me: 	Don't worry, I'll make sure you stay the same color. (I have an idea.)
    Narr:	You barely manage to drag Stacy's mindless body out of the cabin.
    Narr:	If someone saw her right now, for the first time, they'd think she was born blind and deaf.
    Me: 	Look, Stacy! We're outside!
    Stacy:	Best Gemini free?
    Me: 	Yes, free! Look at the trees and nature and...
    Me: 	See that? That's THE SUN!
    Stacy:	Huh?
    Me: 	You still have nature's lighter at your disposal.
    Me: 	A giant, infernal ball of heat and flames. Isn't that great?
    Stacy:	S-S-S... Un...
    Me: 	Yes, that's right, Sun. It's fire, isn't it?
    Me: 	Can you feel how warm the Sun is?
    Stacy:	Ahh, Sun... Sun... Sun...
    Stacy:	Flames, fire, heat...
    Narr:	It takes Stacy a few moments to get her mind up and running.
    Stacy:	Yes, the Sun! PRAISE THE SUN!
    Stacy:	Ahhhh, I can feel it seeping into my soul...
    Stacy:	Purging vile thoughts and sickness!
    Narr:	Unexpectedly, Stacy hugs you...
    Narr:	And plants a kiss on your cheek.
    Stacy:	Thanks, [m!t].
    Me: 	Yeeeah, no problem. (Was she for real?)
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	Ummm, you can let go now.
    Stacy:	Right, sorry.
    Me: 	No worries.
    Me: 	There's a briefing at the Community Area.
    Me: 	You should attend.
    Stacy:	Okay, I will.
    Narr:	Stacy immediately runs off towards the Community Area.
    Me: 	(Abrupt ending...)
    Narr:	Approaching their cabin door, you knock.
    Stacy:	Yeah?
    Narr:	Slowly, you open the door.
    Me: 	Hey, it's me. I was just...
    Me: 	What the...
    Narr:	Stacy stands in the middle of the room, staring at a lighter's flame.
    Stacy:	Hi, [m!t].
    Me: 	What are you doing with that lighter!?
    Stacy:	Meditating, focusing, communing...
    Stacy:	Call it what you will.
    Me: 	(Maybe I shouldn't have let her keep those...)
    Me: 	(There's Belle, still sleeping, it seems.)
    Me: 	How long have you been doing this, Stacy? (She's making me nervous...)
    Stacy:	Doing what?
    Me: 	The lighter... Meditation or whatever.
    Stacy:	I don't know, a couple of hours?
    Me: 	COUPLE OF--Ahhm... That long, huh? (This chick is nuts!)
    Me: 	Anyway, can you put that down?
    Me: 	We have a briefing at the Community Area. Everyone has to attend.
    Stacy:	Huh? The "what" now?
    Me: 	The Community Area? The place where you'll have sessions?
    Stacy:	Of course. I'll head there straight away.
    Stacy:	Yesterday was fun, wasn't it?
    Me: 	What do you mean?
    Stacy:	When you came?
    Me: 	W-W-WHAT?! I-I-I "CAME"!?
    Stacy:	Eww, just now? In here? Gross...
    Me: 	No! What!? You're confusing me...
    Me: 	*Sigh* You said I "came"?
    Stacy:	No, I didn't.
    Me: 	I JUST heard you say it!
    Stacy:	Yeah, we were hanging out.
    Me: 	(So it was Stacy! Shit! I remember being with someone, but vaguely...)
    Me: 	(I thought it was a dream.)
    Me: 	What were we doing anyway?
    Stacy:	What do you mean?
    Me: 	Yesterday, what did we do?
    Stacy:	But, we weren't together yesterday.
    Me: 	That wasn't you? At the campfire?
    Stacy:	Who else, silly?
    Me: 	Get your story straight!
    Me: 	Were we together last night or not!?
    Stacy:	Why are you yelling at me?
    Me: 	I... I'm not...
    Stacy:	Yes, we had lots of fun. 
    Stacy:	*Chuckle* LOTS of fun.
    Me: 	Stacy? Stacy!? What did we do!?
    Stacy:	The Community Area, right?
    Narr:	Stacy turns off the lighter, pockets it...
    Narr:	And leaves.
    Me: 	(What the fuck just happened!?)
    Me: 	(And what the fuck happened yesterday!?)
    Me: 	(I found her there and I remember a weird smell...)
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	(I can't, my mind's a blank.)
    Me: 	*Sigh* (Whatever, I have to wake up Belle anyway.)
    Me: 	(Amazing that she's still asleep after all this ruckus.)
    Narr:	Approaching Belle's bed...
    Me: 	Belle, wake up.
    Belle:	...
    Narr:	Unsure what else to do, you try nudging her a bit.
    Me: 	Hey, Belle, come on.
    Me: 	It's time for your first briefing...
    Me: 	Get up!
    Belle:	...
    Me: 	(Is she fucking with me?)
    Narr:	This time, you nudge her harder, almost shaking her.
    Me: 	"This is your mother speaking, you are late for school, young lady!"
    Belle:	*Mumbling* Nooo...
    Narr:	As you try waking her up, Belle turns.
    Narr:	Spreading her arms and legs.
    Me: 	Holy-- (Her tit fell out...)
    Me: 	(What's with sleeping girls and their tits? Do all girl's tits fall out when they sleep?)
    Me: 	(Although, I wouldn't mind squeezing those beauties for a bit...)
            Narr:	Does Belle have her dildo?
    Me: 	(What's...)
    Me: 	*Gasp* (WAIT, WHAT!?!)
    Me: 	(Is that a... Is that a...)
    Me: 	(A DILDO INSIDE HER!?!)
    Me: 	(SHE HAD A DILDO INSIDE HER ALL NIGHT LONG?!)
    Belle:	*Gentle snore*
    Me: 	(How can you fall asleep like that!?)
    Me: 	(Shit, what do I do with her now?)
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	(She looks so kinky with that thing sticking out of her...)
        Me: 	(What would happen if I gave it a little push?)
            Me: 	(No, I shouldn't...)
            Me: 	(I really, really, REALLY shouldn't.)
            Me: 	...
            Me: 	(But I'll do it anyway...)
            Me: 	(It's just sitting there...)
            Me: 	(All alone and vulnerable...)
            Me: 	(I can't help myself.)
            Me: 	(Okay, just a small nudge. That's all. Then I'll leave.)
            Narr:	Nervously, you extend your arm toward her stuffed pussy...
            Narr:	Gently, you poke the dildo and...
            Narr:	Nothing happens. No reaction out of Belle.
            Me: 	(I should've expected something like that wouldn't get her going.)
            Me: 	(Then what if I...)
            Narr:	Putting your fingers on the bottom of the dildo...
            Narr:	You slowly push it in.
            Belle:	*Soft moan*
            Me: 	(Holy shit! It's actually going in so easily!?)
            Me: 	(Into that greedy pussy of hers...)
            Narr:	Suddenly, you notice Belle start squirming a bit.
            Narr:	Afraid she might wake up at any moment, you pull back your hand.
            Narr:	As you do, the pressure pushes the dildo back out.
            Narr:	Only this time, it doesn't stay partially inside her...
            Narr:	It softly slips out of her with a surprisingly sensual sound.
            Narr:	Frozen in time, you simply appreciate what you just witnessed.
            Me: 	(I'm speechless...)
            Me: 	(This was pretty amazing.)
            Me: 	(Still, I should get the fuck out of here. I pushed my luck far enough as it is.)
            Me: 	(Just imagine her waking up, and seeing me creeping on her...)
            Me: 	(Even though she'd probably enjoy it...)
            Narr:	You take another look at this lewd image, lest you forget.
            Me: 	(Still, can't say it's not hot...)
            Narr:	Before leaving the cabin completely...
            Me: 	(No, I shouldn't... That wouldn't be fair to Jane.)
            Me: 	(Even though she IS spread like...)
            Me: 	(No, stop thinking that shit.)
            Me: 	...
            Me: 	(No, definitely not.)
            Me: 	(And I'm DEFINITELY NOT waking her up.)
            Me: 	(Just imagine waking her up, catching me creeping on her...)
            Me: 	(Even though she'd probably enjoy it...)
            Narr:	Before leaving the cabin completely...
            Narr:	You take another look at this lewd image, lest you forget.
            Me: 	(Still, can't say it's not hot...)
            Narr:	Before leaving the cabin completely...
    Me: 	(Guess I should go to the Community Area...)
    Me: 	(Guess I should go find the rest of them...)
    Narr:	As you approach the back deck of the Community Area, you notice Eve and the girls.
    Narr:	As you make it to the Community Area's patio, you notice Eve and the girls.
Eve:	Okay, everyone ready?
Violet:	Aren't we missing someone?
Stacy:	Belle.
Eve:	Yeah, where's Belle? [m!t]?
Me: 	Probably still sleeping.
Eve:	You didn't wake her up?
Me: 	It's impossible to wake her up. (Not to mention, borderline life-ruining.)
Eve:	You seriously think I believe that?
Me: 	Go ahead, you try and wake her up. Be my guest.
Eve:	I don't get it. Is something wrong?
Me: 	Yeah, you could say so.
Eve:	What is it?
Me: 	I'd rather not say out loud.
Eve:	*Sigh* Alright, give me a few minut-...
Belle:	Morning everyooone!
Eve:	Or not. (Jesus, she's barely wearing anything.)
Naomi:	(Slut...)
Belle:	The main attraction has arrived!
Narr:	Looking around, you notice unsatisfactory expressions on every face.
Narr:	Except Stacy, of course. She's having a blast in her own world.
Me: 	How did you even find us?
Belle:	Oh, come now, isn't it obvious?
Me: 	Not really, no.
Belle:	It's that manly musk of yours that drew me here. *Sniff* *Sniff*
Naomi:	Stop fucking around!
Belle:	Okay, okay... The camp is small, it wasn't difficult to find you.
Naomi:	That's not what I meant!
Belle:	You should really work on your communication skills if you want to get the point across.
Naomi:	Who the hell do you think you are?!
Naomi:	How dare you waste my precious time, you bitch?!
Naomi:	And the way you dress... Talk about a cry for help, revolting!
Belle:	Sounds like someone doesn't feel comfortable in their skin.
Naomi:	I'll kick your ass so--
Eve:	QUIET!
Eve:	Violent behavior will earn you a one-way ticket out of camp!
Naomi:	*Scoff* (She'd deserve it...)
Belle:	Ha-Ha!
Eve:	ENOUGH!
Eve:	That includes you too!
Eve:	Lack of respect for your fellow patients and staff... Unacceptable!
Eve:	Learn to behave or there will be trouble.
Belle:	Yes, ma'am...
Eve:	Good. Glad you understand.
Eve:	Now, we need to deal with your... choice of fashion.
Eve:	I'll accompany you to your cabin.
Eve:	And, if you haven't brought adequate clothes with you, well...
Eve:	We'll just supply you with some of our spare clothes.
Belle:	*Sarcastic* Oh no, the tragedy.
Eve:	Boring, desexualizing, spare clothes...
Belle:	Noooo! Don't make me look mediocre, anything but that!
Eve:	If you want to look pretty, I suggest you find something suitable for the occasion.
Belle:	Yes, I will, on my way! Thank you!
Narr:	Belle rushes off to save her looks and charm.
Me: 	(Wow, Eve's scary. She straightened her out in less than a minute.)
Eve:	Anyway... I'll go "help" Belle.
Eve:	So, please wait just a little while longer.
Eve:	[m!t], keep the girls entertained. I'll be back soon.
Narr:	Everyone watches Eve walk away.
Narr:	And once she's no longer in sight...
Narr:	Their attention shifts elsewhere.
Me: 	(Great...)
Narr:	A while later...
Stacy:	And so, by the time I got out...
Stacy:	There was this giant squid coiling around my thigh.
Stacy:	It felt really pleasant, actually.
Naomi:	Hahaha, I-I-I can't... I can't breathe!
Me: 	Haha, you sick tentacle girl!
Violet:	Ewww! Isn't it, like, slimy and soft?
Stacy:	That's the whole point, Violet.
Stacy:	Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you NEVER thought of animals that way.
svi ...
Belle:	We're baaaack!
Belle:	Did you miss us?
Me: 	Partially...
Belle:	Only the good bits, I hope.
Eve:	Alright everyone, let's get inside and get comfortable, we're about to start.
Eve:	Not you, [m!ct]. This is for patients' ears only.
Me: 	Sooo, what should I do?
Eve:	You're free, for now.
Me: 	Cool. (Later, suckers!)
Narr:	Feeling good about yourself, you leave before Eve changes her mind.
Narr:	You enter the main house hoping to get some rest.
    Narr:	Entering the living room, you spot Kiara chilling on the couch, having a bowl of cereal.
    Me: 	Hey, Kiara.
    Kiara:	Oh, it's you.
    Me: 	You sound disappointed.
    Kiara:	I am.
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	Not enough dick to go around, huh?
    Kiara:	Go drool over the patients... you cheating bastard.
    Kiara:	You haven't seen Jane for two days, and you're already looking for a substitute.
    Me: 	Don't you dare bring Jane into this.
    Kiara:	Or what? Your feelings are going to get hurt?
    Kiara:	Truth hurts, you know.
    Me: 	Kiara, I'm bored out of my damn mind...
    Me: 	And the only people who are willing to spend time with me are the patients.
    Me: 	Unlike YOU, who's obviously avoiding me.
    Kiara:	That's mostly your fault.
    Me: 	Yeah, sorry you're not the hottest chick around anymore. 
    Me: 	I guess they fucked up everything for you, right?
    Me: 	I bet your ego hurts as much as your vagina itches.
    Kiara:	What?
    Me: 	Your ego h--
    Kiara:	Before that!
    Me: 	"Sorry you're not the hottest chick around anymore."
    Kiara:	You think I'm hot?
    Me: 	What is this? Am I talking to Emily all of a sudden?
    Kiara:	Well, you said it, and now I'm curious.
    Me: 	You two are so alike...
    Kiara:	Just answer the damn question!
    Me: 	*Sigh* Yeah, I think you are very, very pretty. Just like Emily.
    Me: 	Happy?
    Kiara:	*Chuckle* (Oh, she definitely heard the last part.)
    Me: 	What?
    Kiara:	Nothing, it's just... *Chuckle*
    Me: 	WHAT!?
    Narr:	Entering the living room, you spot Kiara chilling on the couch, having a bowl of cereal.
    Me: 	Hey, Kiara.
    Kiara:	Hey [m!ct], been busy?
    Me: 	Barely had breakfast.
    Kiara:	Everything's normal, then.
    Me: 	Don't tell me it's like this all the time...
    Kiara:	*Slurp*
    Me: 	Kiara?
    Kiara:	*Crunch*
    Me: 	It's like this all the time, huh?
    Kiara:	Yup.
    Me: 	*Sigh* Fuck.
    Kiara:	You'll get used to it.
    Me: 	I mean, the patients are cool, but why the hell does she need me here anyway?
    Kiara:	*Stare*
    Me: 	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to complain.
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	I'm sorry you had to put up with this shit-storm on your own.
    Narr:	For a moment, Kiara looks at you with the most loving eyes.
    Narr:	Then reverts to her previous state.
    Kiara:	*Silently* Thanks... That means a lot.
    Me: 	Kiara I--
Narr:	Suddenly, you hear loud footsteps behind you.
Emily:	BOMBS AWAAAAAY!
Me: 	Oooompf--
Emily:	Hello, [m!ct]. I missed you! (I need to iron out that last conversation, if I want him to think of me in a better light.)
Me: 	*Wheezing* Hi, Emily.
Emily:	I'm not that heavy, am I?
Me: 	*Still wheezing* No, no, feather-light...
Kiara:	Can't you be a bit more careful? (She always acts so childi--)
Emily:	Can't you be a bit more fun? (She's always such a bitc--)
Kiara:	You're mistaking annoyance for fun.
Emily:	And YOU'RE going to teach me the difference?
Me: 	(I better stay quiet...)
Me: 	(Don't want any stray bullets hitting my face.)
Narr:	As they continue bickering, Emily keeps squirming and pressing down on your cock with her tight ass.
Narr:	Inevitably resulting in increased blood flow below the waist.
Me: 	(Shit, this is not good! I'm getting hard!)
Emily:	Whatever, I don't need to listen to anything you say.
Kiara:	Finally something we can agree on.
Me: 	Kiara, come on...
Narr:	Without saying another word, Kiara leaves the room.
Emily:	Oh, just leave her. Who needs her, anyway? (That's right, Kiara, keep walking...)
Emily:	You and me can still have fun, right?
Me: 	Right... (Damn it. At this rate, I'll never have time to properly talk to Kiara.)
Narr:	For a moment, you forget about your ever-growing erection...
Narr:	And it gets big, and hard, enough for Emily to notice.
Emily:	(Oh, what's this? Something's poking my butt?)
Narr:	She squirmed a bit more, like trying to find a comfortable position on your lap.
Emily:	*Chuckle* (He got hard! Because of me?)
Emily:	So, [m!ct]... What are you doing with the rest of your day? (I'm definitely gonna tease you a bit more...)
Me: 	Oh, you know, nothing much. (Shit! She can feel it now, for sure.)
Emily:	Maybe we could have some fun together?
Narr:	Emily moves and shifts as she talks...
Narr:	Constantly teasing your length.
Me: 	I-I don't know. I'll probably be busy. (I need to get her off me somehow.)
    Me: 	I-I don't know. I'll probably be busy. (I need to get her off me somehow.)
        Me: 	Sorry...
        Narr:	With Emily still sitting on your lap, you stand up and lift her...
        Narr:	Trying your best not to let your boner touch her...
        Emily:	Oh, my... (I didn't know [m!t] was this strong.)
        Emily:	Well aren't you a dream-boat... (He lifted me effortlessly.)
        Me: 	My leg was going numb, had to.
        Emily:	Mhmmm, I see... (You're full of shit.)
        Narr:	You put her down and quickly turn around.
        Narr:	Hoping she doesn't see your bulge...
        Me: 	I'm gonna go for a walk, see what's going on. (I need to get away from her.)
        Emily:	Okay, have fun. (He's cute when he's flustered. I think [m!t] might be packing.)
        Emily:	(I wouldn't mind sneaking a peek...)
        Narr:	Finally, as you're about to leave...
        Narr:	You bump into Eve, turning the corner.
        Eve:	Hey! What's the rush, [m!t]?
        Me: 	Sorry. I was heading out.
        Eve:	Here, take this...
        Eve:	On that list you'll find several chores that need to be done.
        Eve:	I'd appreciate it immensely if you could help out with this.
        Me: 	Umm, sure...
        Me: 	I’ll have the chores done in less than an hour.
        Emily:	Oh, really? Want to bet on that?
        Me: 	*Scoff* Why would I bet with YOU?
        Emily:	So I can get something from you when I win.
        Me: 	IF you win...
            Me: 	IF you win...
                Me: 	If I'm done with everything before this afternoon, you'll owe me a favor that I can cash in any time.
                Emily:	And, if you lose, you have to do whatever I want, once.
                Me: 	Deal.
                Emily:	Deal.
                Me: 	I can't wait to prove you wrong.
                Emily:	We'll see about that.
                Me: 	Oh, we will see.
                Emily:	Oookay, [m!t].
                Me: 	See you in an hour!
                Narr:	Feeling amused and surprisingly motivated, you speed off towards camp.
                Me: 	No, thanks. I don't have anything to prove to you.
                Emily:	Oh, come on! Be more spontaneous!
                Me: 	Some other time, Em.
                Narr:	Somewhat annoyed, yet surprisingly motivated, you speed off toward camp.
        Me: 	(Maybe she hasn't noticed, otherwise she'd mention something, right?)
        Me: 	(I should keep my cool and pretend nothing's happening.)
        Narr:	Which you find very hard to do...
        Narr:	Since she's still clinging onto you, squirming in your lap.
        Emily:	Come ooon, let's hang out more. (Let me play with you!)
        Me: 	I'd love to hang out with you, but I'll probably have to help out around camp some more.
        Emily:	*Sigh* I guess so. (Bah, how boring.)
        Me: 	(Alright, she'll probably let up now.)
        Emily:	*Stare*
        Me: 	Uhhh...
        Emily:	How about later, then?
        Me: 	I mean, I'd like to. I just don't--
        Narr:	Squirming and begging in your lap, Emily is getting restless.
        Emily:	Come oooooonnnnnn... (Damn, he's really hard...) 
        Emily:	I wanna spend some time with youuuu! (And huge!)
        Me: 	Alright, fine! We'll figure something out. (She's definitely grinding me on purpose. What is she thinking!?)
        Emily:	Yaaay! Fun times with [m!t]! *Chuckles* (Maybe I'll even get to see it.)
        Narr:	Suddenly, Eve appears in the living room...
        Eve:	Thought I'd find you here.
        Emily:	Hi!
        Eve:	I'd appreciate it immensely if you could help out with this.
        Eve:	I know this wasn't what you had in mind, but...
        Emily:	[m!ct] would be happy to do it, right?
        Eve:	You're a sweetheart, [m!t].
        Me: 	Great, thanks.
        Narr:	With that, Eve leaves the room.
        Narr:	Smiling sincerely, Emily turns back towards you.
        Me: 	Wow, Emily... Thank you. I can't believe you stood up for me.
        Me: 	Thank you SO MUCH for suggesting I'd be happy to do those chores.
        Emily:	You're VERY welcome!
        Me: 	Hah-Umm, yeah...
        Emily:	Ooh, can't wait. *Chuckle*
        Me: 	Hah-Umm, yeah... (Someone kill me, please!)
        Emily:	See you later, [m!t].
        Narr:	Giggly and playful, Emily prances out of the room...
Me: 	(I have what I need.)
        Me: 	For fuck's sake... (How am I supposed to fix the roof?)
        Me: 	(I'll have to find a hammer, some planks and a way to get up there.)
        Me: 	(I'm still missing the tools to fix the roof.)
        Me: 	(They should be around here somewhere.)
    Me: 	(Now, to fix the roof...)
    Me: 	Okay, let's try to get up there.
    Me: 	(Eve sent me here to die, I just know it.)
    Me: 	(And... these chores aren't helping.)
    Me: 	(Thank God I don't have vertigo.)
    Narr:	Struggling to lift yourself and the equipment, you manage to climb onto the roof.
    Me: 	(That could've been worse.)
    Me: 	(For a second, I thought I'd break my neck or something.)
    Me: 	Right. (Let's find this hole...)
    Me: 	(Why they haven't patched it already is beyond me...)
    Me: 	(Ah, here it is.)
    Narr:	Beneath your feet, you spot a large hole in the roof.
    Me: 	(I'm surprised Naomi hasn't complained about it already.)
    Narr:	At that moment, Naomi pops into view in the cabin.
    Me: 	(Oh, she's already back?)
    Me: 	(What is she doing?)
    Narr:	To your utmost surprise, Naomi starts taking off her dress...
    Me: 	(Hah, just stripping!)
        Me: 	(Hah, just stripping!)
            Me: 	(I'll see her tits if I keep this up!)
            Me: 	(I'm making a bad habit out of spying...)
            Me: 	(But how can I not?)
            Me: 	(I mean, just look at her...)
            Me: 	(I'm not capable of saying "no" to this opportunity!)
            Narr:	Naomi holds her dress in one hand...
            Narr:	And drops it on the floor.
            Narr:	As she turns around, you get a good birds-eye-view of Naomi's chest.
            Me: 	(Wow, she's fucking hot!)
            Me: 	(Even though she IS a princess...)
            Me: 	(And, not the charming and affectionate type, either.)
                Me: 	(And, not the charming and affectionate type, either.)
                    Me: 	(She's just standing there, tits out...)
                    Me: 	(What's she thinking?)
                    Narr:	Naomi suspiciously looks around for a few seconds...
                    Narr:	Before slowly bending over...
                    Me: 	(Wait, you're not gonna...)
                    Narr:	And dropping her panties.
                    Narr:	Your vantage point is perfect, allowing you to get a nice view of her ass.
                    Me: 	(She's completely naked! Not even wearing underwear!)
                    Narr:	Now nude, Naomi walks towards her bed...
                    Narr:	And sits her round butt on it.
                    Me: 	(Damn, woman! You're one hot piece of ass, that's for sure.)
                    Me: 	(Though, I'm a bit more tense with her facing this way.)
                    Me: 	(If she looks up, she might see me...)
                        Me: 	(If she looks up, she might see me...)
                            Me: 	(I mean, I'm too far gone already, aren't I?)
                            Me: 	(I just wanna enjoy this moment a little longer.)
                            Narr:	Naomi's still sitting on her bed... still looking around suspiciously.
                            Me: 	(What's she looking for?)
                            Me: 	(Maybe she's checking to see if anyone's around...)
                            Me: 	(But, wait! That means she could...)
                            Narr:	Your suspicions seem to materialize, as Naomi "inconspicuously" spreads her legs...
                            Me: 	(She's really going to finger herself!?)
                            Me: 	(Why doesn't she at least pull a blanket over herself or something?)
                            Me: 	(Man, I'm rock-hard as is...)
                            Me: 	(I'll lose my mind if she starts playing with herself!)
                            Narr:	She starts gently caressing her pussy, as you watch, hoping the show will heat up...
                            Me: 	(Man, I just want to plow that pussy, and--)
                            Narr:	With her hand still between her legs...
                            Narr:	Naomi suddenly lifts her head. 
                            Narr:	Looking you directly in the eyes, with a smirk on her face.
                            Me: 	Shit! (Wait, she knew I was here the whole time!?)
                            Narr:	The shock almost makes you jump out of your skin.
                            Narr:	It didn’t, but it did throw off your balance.
                            Me: 	Ho-O-oooo-Llly...
                            Me: 	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...
                            Narr:	Of course, the obvious happens...
                            noname We have to get you to a hospital!
                            Me: 	The hospital? What are you talking about?
                            Naomi:	You're right, you probably don't need one.
                            Me: 	Naomi?
                            Naomi:	Yes, it's Naomi.
                            Naomi:	[m!ct]?
                            Naomi:	[m!ut]!
                            Me: 	Huh, yeah?
                            Naomi:	Are you hurt?
                            Me: 	I-Ugh...
                            Me: 	(Wow, nice view...)
                            Naomi:	[m!ct]?
                            Me: 	(I wouldn't mind dying like this.)
                            Naomi:	[m!ut]?!
                            Me: 	Huh? Sorry, what did you say?
                            Naomi:	Are you hurt!?
                            Me: 	Ummm...
                            Me: 	Let me check...
                            Me: 	(Just my imagination... or brain damage...)
                            Me: 	Yeah... No, I think I'm fine.
                            Me: 	I was able to land safely, somehow.
                            Naomi:	"Land"? More like crash!
                            Naomi:	You bounced back up like three feet in the air...
                            Naomi:	It's a miracle you're alive. (Maybe a clot kills him in three years, though...)
                            Me: 	What doesn't kill me, right?
                            Naomi:	Maybe... If the fall hasn't caused brain damage.
                            Naomi:	Can you stand up?
                            Me: 	I think so.
                            Narr:	Naomi wraps your arm around her shoulders and tries lifting you up.
                            Naomi:	One... Two... Three!
                            Naomi:	*Grunt*
                            Naomi:	Can you stand?
                            Me: 	Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit dizzy...
                            Me: 	And sore.
                            Naomi:	Thank God. I thought I already managed to kill you with my vagina.
                            Me: 	Mhmm... (You'd love that, wouldn't you?)
                            Naomi:	It’s too bad, though. If you hadn't fallen, you'd have gotten to see the whole show.
                            Me: 	Great... I'll have to be stealthier next time.
                            Naomi:	You don't have to sneak around if you want to have fun with me...
                            Naomi:	You should just ask.
                            Naomi:	"Hey, beautiful, sexy Naomi"...
                            Me: 	(Yeah, that's how I'd ask...)
                            Naomi:	"Can I watch you finger your pussy for a while?"
                            Me: 	That's not going to happen... (She really has no shame.)
                            Naomi:	"I can take my dick out, and we can both masturbate to each other's image."
                            Me: 	Naomi, for the hundredth time, I'm seeing someone, and I'm not going to cheat on her!
                            Naomi:	*Scoff* So you'd rather skulk in the shadows and get yourself killed, instead of openly having fun with me?
                            Naomi:	Talk about simpleminded and hypocritical...
                            Me: 	Yeah, I'm a real dumbass.
                            Naomi:	You are, you really are.
                            Narr:	Naomi spins around on her heels...
                            Narr:	And goes back inside the cabin.
                            Me: 	Such a spoiled princess.
                            Me: 	But... (What if she's right?)
                            Me: 	(What if I just asked for it?)
                            Me: 	No, no! Come on! (I can't let her manipulate me like that.)
                            Me: 	(I obviously fell into her trap, and now she's using it against me.)
                            Me: 	(Sneaky little...)
            Me: 	(Enough, I already saw more than I should've.)
            Me: 	(I don't want further problems falling in my lap.)
            Narr:	Not caring about what's happening inside, you patch up the roof.
            Me: 	(Wonderful! Just look at this fabulously patched roof...)
            Me: 	(I really outdid myself.)
            Me: 	(Every construction worker would want me as their son-in-law, that's for sure.)
            Me: 	Okay. (Enough with the self-flattery.)
            Me: 	(I need to get down from here in one piece.)
            Narr:	You get off the roof by climbing down the ladder.
            Me: 	Phew... (I'm surprised I managed to come down unscathed.)
            Me: 	(It's not deadly, but I still want to hit the ground from that height.)
            Me: 	*Chuckle* (Just imagine the impact...)
            Me: 	Hmm, moving on... (What's next on the list?)
Me: 	(A bucket and sponge, there we go.)
Me: 	(Off to polish some wood...)
Me: 	*Sigh* (What a redundant effort.)
        Me: 	(Oh, look. Violet's already on the dock.)
        Me: 	(Letting that sexy butt take in the sun...)
        Me: 	(I should go get the stuff to clean the dock before I get totally distracted.)
        Me: 	(It's impossible to clean the dock without a sponge and some cleaning agent.)
        Me: 	(I could probably find that stuff in the main house's bathroom.)
    Narr:	You approach the dock...
    Narr:	Before you could say anything, Violet hears your footsteps and turns to face you.
    Me: 	Hey, Violet.
    Violet:	Hey, busy-bee. Whatcha doin'?
    Me: 	Swabbin' the deck, cap'n.
    Violet:	*Chuckle* I better leave you to it, swabbie.
    Me: 	Yarrr...
    Narr:	You get on all fours and start polishing.
    Narr:	It's not very fulfilling, nor is it fun. 
    Narr:	And, it doesn't take long for your mind to begin looking for something more interesting to occupy itself with.
    Narr:	Violet's voluptuous glutes were more than "interesting".
    Me: 	(Is this what summer's gonna be like?)
    Me: 	(Besieged by tits and butts wherever I go?)
    Me: 	(Yet, I can't touch anything?)
    Me: 	*Sigh* (My balls will change color by the end of summer.)
    Violet:	Something wrong?
    Me: 	Uhh.. No, no.
    Me: 	I'm just not very motivated to clean something that's left to the mercy of the elements year-round.
    Me: 	Doesn't really make sense.
    Violet:	Maybe you could... You know...
    Violet:	If it's not a problem or anything...
    Violet:	If you're not too busy...
    Me: 	What do you need?
    Violet:	It's so hot outside... and I'm afraid of getting sunburned, and...
    Violet:	I'd do it myself, but I'm a bit sore...
    Violet:	If it's not too much to ask...
    Me: 	Just spit it out.
    Violet:	Could you... Put some sunscreen on my back?
    Me: 	Okay. (You don't have to tell me twice!)
    Violet:	Okay? OKAY!
    Violet:	Ummm... Here's the sunscreen.
    Violet:	You can start wherev--
    Violet:	Whenever you like.
    Me: 	Sure.
    Narr:	You apply the sunscreen...
            Me: 	Whoops!
            Narr:	You underestimate your own strength, and squeeze the bottle way too hard...
            Narr:	Spraying a geyser of sunscreen all over Violet’s back.
            Violet:	[m!ct]!
            Me: 	Sorry! I didn’t think this would happen.
            Violet:	It’s fine, it was an accident.
            Violet:	But, now I have to go wash this all off.
            Violet:	See you later.
            Me: 	See ya.
            Me: 	(Well, I guess better get back to work, then...)
    Narr:	And begin spreading it around Violet's back.
    Violet:	Mmmm, feels nice...
    Me: 	(So do you.)
    Violet:	Mmmm...
    Me: 	(Her purring isn't helping.)
    Violet:	D-Do you mind if I undo my top?
    Violet:	I don't wanna get tan lines.
    Me: 	Go ahead, I don't mind. (Fuck, her skin feels so nice under my fingertips.)
    Narr:	To your surprise, Violet doesn't just undo her bikini's top, she removes it completely.
    Narr:	You continue massaging-in the sunscreen.
    Narr:	But you couldn't apply proper pressure from this position.
    Me: 	Hey, would you mind if I get on your back? It's a bit difficult to massage the sunscreen on like this.
    Violet:	Uh, yeah... Go ahead. (He's getting on top of me?)
    Narr:	You extend your leg and "mount" Violet.
    Me: 	(Is it getting hot in here, or am I just having a heat stroke?)
    Violet:	Mmmm, you're right, it's even better this way.
    Violet:	And your hands feel wonderful.
    Me: 	I'm glad you like it. (This is making me rock hard...)
    Me: 	(I mean, I'm sitting on her ass...)
    Me: 	(Touching her bare back...)
    Me: 	Uhh-Gladly. (Whoops, was I a bit too direct.)
    Violet:	*Chuckle* ("Gladly"? That means he's enjoying it too, right?)
    Narr:	You stand up and turn around, facing Violet's firm legs.
    Narr:	You sit on her back, but this time, you have a first-row view of her ass.
    Me: 	(My God, just look at those plump hills.)
    Me: 	(And my boner is nearly touching them.)
    Me: 	(I wish I could relieve myself with these cheeks.)
    Me: 	(Cum all over her...)
    Me: 	(And smear it in like sunscreen...)
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	(I keep thinking of sex and having erections all the time.)
    Me: 	(Seems like that one time with Jane was far from enough.)
    Me: 	(It only served to get me going more...)
    Me: 	(I better wrap this up before it gets too awkward.)
    Narr:	You stand up again.
    Narr:	With the job complete, and wanting to get off as soon as possible, you clap your hands.
    Me: 	There, all done! (Now to get off of you, so you don't see my hard-on.)
    Violet:	AAaahhhh!
    Narr:	Unexpectedly, Violet makes a noise...
    Narr:	For a small, miniscule moment, you could bet it sounded a bit like a moan.
    Me: 	Huh? (Did she just...)
    Violet:	*Pant* *Nervous chuckle* Sorry, there was... A bug! (Fuck, he caught me off guard!)
    Violet:	It startled me, that's all. (He probably suspects something's wrong.)
    Me: 	U-Huh... (Who makes such a hot noise when they get startled?)
    Violet:	I-I have to go. I'll talk to you later. (I need to leave before he starts asking questions.)
    Narr:	As soon as she can, Violet gets up and scurries away.
    Me: 	(What was that all about?)
    Me: 	(Whatever it was, it doesn't change the fact that I need to scrub this dock.)
    Me: 	*Sigh* Wax off, wax on...
    Narr:	What seems like eons later...
    Me: 	There, fuck...
    Me: 	Finally done!
    Me: 	*Grunt* (My right arm hurts so bad, I don't think I'll be able to jerk off for a while.)
Narr:	You arrive at the chopping block.
Me: 	(What do we need wood for, anyway? It's an inferno outside.)
Me: 	(She probably just wants me to "build character" or some crap.)
Me: 	(Get all sweaty and disgusting for no real reason...)
Me: 	*Sigh* (Whatever, I better just get it over with.)
Me: 	(Maybe, she wants to see me all sweaty and manly...)
Me: 	(With all the teasing...)
Me: 	Now then...
Me: 	...
Me: 	(Where's the axe?)
Me: 	Where's the bloody axe?!
Me: 	Damn it... (Why can't it ever be easy?)
Me: 	Oh, here it is.
Me: 	Man, I should really get my eyes checked out...
Me: 	... (Now that I look at the camp a bit, axe in hand...)
Me: 	... (Seems like a good setting for gory horror stories.)
Me: 	Hmm... (If I was a psycho, I think I'd enjoy it.)
Me: 	(Just imagine what would happen...)
Me: 	(If the wrong person got their hands on it...)
Me: 	...
Me: 	(Maybe not.)
Me: 	Now, where did we leave off?
Me: 	Ah, yes!
Me: 	"Mr. Tree,", you thought you could get away from me, did you?
Me: 	*High-pitched voice* No, sir, please, I have thirty-odd wives and several thousand children!
Me: 	Shh, shh, shh... Don't be scared.
Me: 	A lot of trees end up as firewood, it's the natural order of things.
Me: 	*High-pitched voice* NO, it's not natural! Humans are not natural, they're monsters!
Me: 	Well, you may be right, "Mr. Tree"...
Me: 	But at the end of the day, you're sitting on a log, and I'm holding the axe.
Me: 	*High-pitched voice* Nooooo!
Me: 	I'm sorry.
Me: 	And... Mr. Tree?
Me: 	*High-pitched voice* Y-Yes, [m!ct]?
Me: 	For what it's worth, you were the best of us.
Me: 	May Gaia have mercy on your soul...
Narr:	As you say this, you lift the axe up, above your head...
Me: 	*High-pitched voice* Goodbye, Olivia... I guess I won't be coming home after all.
Narr:	Several chops later...
Narr:	You're already shirtless and sweaty...
Me: 	*Singing* Cutting wood...
Me: 	And wadda'ya get...
Me: 	A prisoner...
Me: 	In a rehab center...
Me: 	Swinging my axe...
Me: 	And-AAAAHHHH!
Narr:	You get startled, throwing your hands in the air...
Narr:	Along with the axe...
Narr:	It doesn't take long for it to come back down.
Me: 	STACY!? You scared the shit out of me.
Stacy:	Charred Kings guide your way.
Me: 	I almost lost a foot...
Me: 	How did you even...
Stacy:	You were busy talking to that piece of wood, and I didn't want to interrupt.
Stacy:	Seemed important.
Me: 	Yeah, it was. Just don't tell anyone I'm talking to logs, okay?
Me: 	I'll end up as a patient...
Stacy:	So what? I talk to fire all the time.
Me: 	Yeah... Of course you do. (She's rubbing off on me in a very bad way.)
Stacy:	*Stare*
Me: 	So, did you need something or have you come here to indirectly assassinate me?
Stacy:	No, just finished with the briefing...
Stacy:	Then I got drawn by the sound of future fires and ran into you.
Stacy:	*Stare*
Me: 	Hey, my eyes are up here.
Stacy:	I am aware.
Me: 	(This fucking chick...)
Stacy:	So, are you making a fire? For me?
Me: 	Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing.
Me: 	All I know is that this wood needs chopping.
Stacy:	Spoken like a true lumberjack.
Me: 	Thanks. (I'm not sure if that was an insult or a compliment...)
Me: 	Do you mind if I-Uhhh, continue?
Stacy:	No, of course not!
Stacy:	I'll just sit here, quiet as a bug.
Narr:	Stacy sits on the fence, still eyeing you intently.
Me: 	(I can practically feel her drooling...)
Me: 	(But it kinda feels nice, knowing that a gorgeous woman is eyeing you.)
Me: 	(If she's enjoying it, maybe I should as well?)
Me: 	(Flex my muscles a bit and stuff.)
Narr:	Stacy continues to admire your sweaty manliness, while you take extra effort to look even more attractive.
Narr:	And before you know it, Stacy has something to say...
Stacy:	You're remarkably well-built.
Me: 	Thanks. (Yeah, she likes what she sees.)
Stacy:	Something I didn't noticed yesterday.
Me: 	(Yesterday? Shit, I completely forgot about that!)
Me: 	S-so, w-what were we doing yesterday, huh?
Stacy:	Hanging out, inhaling spirits...
Me: 	That's right, we were smoking something... Funny...
Stacy:	*Chuckle* Yeah, it was funny.
Me: 	What do you mean?
Stacy:	Well, with all the kissing and...
Me: 	KISSING!? You're joking, right?
Stacy:	*Stare*
Me: 	You're not joking?
Stacy:	*Stare*
Me: 	(She's not joking...)
Me: 	But I remember almost nothing.
Me: 	What the hell did we smoke yesterday?
Stacy:	I can't remember.
Me: 	...
Me: 	(I expected too much from her.)
Me: 	*Chuckle* (I'm so fucked...)
Me: 	(I'm not even sure how far we went.)
Me: 	(The only two people who know what happened also have fucking amnesia...)
Me: 	(If I want my life intact, we'll have to keep it a secret.)
Me: 	(We definitely can't let anyone know.)
Me: 	Stacy, I wanna ask you for a favor...
Me: 	Can we keep it a secret? The thing that happened between us?
Me: 	It'll cause problems otherwise.
Me: 	Stacy?
Me: 	Stacy!?
Me: 	(Is that her thing?)
Me: 	(Is that Stacy's thing?)
Me: 	(And they said I'm a creeper...)
Narr:	Some time later...
Me: 	*Pant* I give up. *Pant*
Me: 	(Should be enough to last us through the whole summer...)
Me: 	(And if Eve's not satisfied, she can "build character" herself.)
Narr:	You open the office door and enter.
Belle:	Hey, [m!ct].
Me: 	Woah!
Eve:	[m!ct]! Are you allergic to knocking?
Me: 	Runs in the family.
Eve:	We're having a private session here.
Me: 	My bad, I thought everyone finished already.
Eve:	Why are you here?
Me: 	I'm supposed to clean the office, remember?
Me: 	Your orders.
Eve:	As you can see, we're a bit busy right now.
Eve:	You should come back later. 
Eve:	I forgot to tell you I was holding a session here.
Me: 	Alright, I'll do the rest first.
Me: 	A-And, sorry for intruding.
Belle:	I don't mind.
Eve:	We'll live, just learn to knock, okay?
Me: 	Okay. (Do I really have a knocking problem?)
Narr:	You leave the office and close the door behind you...
Me: 	(I actually might have a knocking problem...)
Me: 	(Not that I lack common courtesy, but I do keep barging in on people.)
Me: 	Nah.
Narr:	You get back to the office.
Me: 	(Belle's probably done by now.)
Me: 	(I should go clean the office.)
Narr:	You knock on the office door.
Narr:	Yet no one answers.
Me: 	(Must be out. Guess that's my cue.)
Narr:	Confident the office is empty, you enter...
Narr:	Only to find another surprise lying in wake.
Belle:	Why, if it isn't my favorite "staff"!
Me: 	Belle? What the hell are you doing in here?
Belle:	Nothin'. Just browsing, that's all.
Me: 	Where's Eve?
Belle:	Oh, she left.
Me: 	And left the office door unlocked?
Belle:	Yes?
Me: 	*Sigh* You're pushing your luck.
Me: 	Wait, whose phone is that?
Belle:	Mine?
Me: 	That's Eve's phone! Why do you have her phone?!
Belle:	I found it here?
Me: 	Here? In the office?
Me: 	So, not only did you break in, but you also took something that doesn't belong to you AND intruded on her privacy?
Belle:	When you put it that way, nothing sounds good.
Me: 	Give it back, NOW!
Belle:	No way, have you seen her photos?
Belle:	Who would've thought Dr. Eve's such a slut.
Belle:	Honestly, they even make me want to fuck her...
Me: 	HEY!
Belle:	Whaaaat? She's hot. You should be happy she's hot.
Me: 	Just give the damn phone back!
Belle:	Fine, sheesh. What's up your bum?
Me: 	Nothing!
Belle:	Maybe that's the problem. *Giggle*
Me: 	Belle...
Belle:	Okay, okay... Tell you what...
Belle:	I'll give it back if you take a few pictures of me.
Me: 	Why should I? I can just report you and be done with it.
Belle:	If you don't, I'll tell everyone you creeped on me this morning.
Me: 	You were awake!?
Belle:	"Tee-hee".
Me: 	*Sigh* FINE! Let's get it over with.
Belle:	Oooh, lovely!
Belle:	Trust me, you'll love it.
Me: 	Whatever... Where do you wanna do this?
Belle:	How about over there, out on the deck?
Me: 	(Something's bound to happen, I just know it.)
Narr:	Still a little pissed off, you exit the office with Belle.
Belle:	Ready?
Me: 	Yeah. What do you even need these for?
Belle:	My site. I'm sure they're very hungry for some fresh content.
Me: 	(Totally nuts...)
Belle:	I didn't post for almost a week. Poor things...
Me: 	Wait, you're not gonna...
Belle:	What do you think?
Me: 	I mean like, here, now, with me!?
Belle:	Yeah, got a problem?
Me: 	*Sigh* Let's just do it before someone sees us...
Narr:	You point the camera at Belle, as she strikes her first pose.
Me: 	Got it. Are we done?
Belle:	*Chuckle* Oh, no, no. This is just the start.
Narr:	Belle smiles slyly as she gets undressed...
Me: 	Oh, God... (What did I get myself into now?)
Narr:	Each of Belle's subsequent poses are sexier and more lewd than the last.
Narr:	Eventually, and inevitably, her seduction gets your dick hard...
Narr:	And it doesn't take Belle long to notice it.
Belle:	Looks like you're a fan as well.
Me: 	Hard not to be with the things you're doing in front of me...
Narr:	Belle gives you a blank stare.
Narr:	Turns around without saying anything.
Narr:	And, all of a sudden, drops her pants and panties around her ankles.
Me: 	(She's getting completely naked!? HERE!?)
Narr:	Still bent over, she glances over her shoulder...
Belle:	Wanna come inside?
Me: 	Uhh...
Narr:	Belle slowly starts twerking and swaying her ass, impatiently calling out to you...
Belle:	Come oooon, just stick it in.
Belle:	I'm ready for you, and you obviously like me.
Me: 	N-N-No! Stop!
Belle:	Awww, too direct?
Me: 	Too everything!
Belle:	Oh, come on, [m!ct]... Would you really deny me this pleasure?
Belle:	How can you say no to this?
Me: 	I have my reasons.
Belle:	Who are you trying to fool with that bulge?
Belle:	Aren't you a man?
Belle:	And a well-endowed one at that. *Chuckle*
Me: 	I'm seeing someone, Belle...
Belle:	*Yawn* Again with that same, boring, excuse.
Belle:	Your girl's not around, just us two.
Belle:	And, I won't tell if you won't.
Me: 	I'm very flattered, but I have principles.
Narr:	Belle takes a look at you, from head to toe, almost as if she was evaluating your worth...
Belle:	Hmm... Give me the phone.
Narr:	You return the phone to Belle.
Narr:	She grabs it and starts typing something in...
Narr:	You can't really see what she's doing, but you wait for her to finish.
Belle:	There, all done.
Me: 	What did you do?
Belle:	Gave my fans what they want.
Belle:	At least they know what they want, and aren't afraid to ask.
Narr:	Still naked, Belle starts walking back to her cabin...
Me: 	W-Wait, you're leaving, like that?
Belle:	Yuuup.
Me: 	Someone's going to see you!
Me: 	Belle!?
Me: 	...
Me: 	*Sigh* If she doesn't give a fuck, neither do I.
Me: 	(I still need to clean the office.)
Me: 	(Better get to it...)
Narr:	Some dusting, mopping and sorting some things here and there...
Narr:	And you're done cleaning the office pretty quickly.
Me: 	*Cough* (Finally, all done.)
Me: 	(No more chores for today, hurrah!)
Me: 	Oh, right. (I still need to give Eve her phone back.)
Me: 	(Her phone with who knows what kind of pics...)
Me: 	Hmm... (Now that I think about it, I'm kinda curious.)
    Me: 	Hmm... (Now that I think about it, I'm kinda curious.)
        Me: 	(I'm just too curious...)
        Me: 	(Who is Eve, really?)
        Me: 	Entering the phone's menu, you see a few folders.
        Narr:	As you open the phone's gallery, you start sifting through its photos...
        Narr:	Most of the pictures are of people she likes, selfies, cats and vistas.
        Me: 	(That's the time she went to Italy...)
        Me: 	(Kiara and Emily...)
        Me: 	(Wow, this one's nice.)
        Me: 	(Oh, look! She even has one of me.)
        Me: 	Huh... (What's Belle talking about?)
        Me: 	(I literally haven't found a single "naughty" photo, let alone a perverse one.)
        Narr:	Almost ready to give up, you scroll a bit further, until you find a selfie of Eve, showing some skin...
        Me: 	There we go. (God, what am I doing?)
        Me: 	(I mean, it's just a "boilerplate" selfie.)
        Me: 	(She even has her bra on... That's, like, full vanilla.)
            Me: 	(She even has her bra on... That's, like, full vanilla.)
                Me: 	Wait... (There's another folder.)
                Me: 	("Gardening"? Since when is Eve into gardening?)
                Narr:	Without really thinking about it, you open the folder...
                Me: 	HO-LY SHIT! (She has some serious nudes in here!)
                Narr:	It's full to the brim with a variety of photos.
                Narr:	But all had one thing in common, SEX... And, Eve...
                Narr:	Eve in tight skimpy clothes...
                Narr:	Eve in thongs...
                Narr:	Eve spread naked on the bed...
                Narr:	Each subsequent picture gets lewder than the last.
                Me: 	(Fuck, Belle was right... Eve IS a closeted slut!)
                Me: 	Fuck. (I got hard... from looking at Eve's lewd body!)
                Narr:	Before you have time to dwell on the morality of the situation...
                Me: 	(Is that a...)
                Me: 	(Is that a BUTTPLUG!?)
                Me: 	(She does ANAL!?)
                Me: 	(This is too much, man. I'm getting dizzy...)
                Narr:	Closing the phone, you head for the door.
                Narr:	You leave the office and continue walking down the hallway toward the house...
                Narr:	Lost in thought, thinking about Eve's delicious tits, you don't notice her coming in your direction...
                Eve:	Hey, daydreamer.
                Me: 	*Gasp*
                Narr:	Encountering Eve, you get startled back into reality.
                Me: 	H-Hey, Eve...
                Eve:	*Chuckle* You're so funny when you're scared.
                Me: 	*Chuckle* Yeah... (Just my luck.)
                Eve:	(Oh, wow, he has an erection again.)
                Eve:	(Heheh, hard to hide a bulge with a dick that big.)
                Eve:	Done cleaning? (I wonder what it is that made him hard...)
                Me: 	Y-Yeah, all done. (Shit, I still have an erection. I better keep this talk short.)
                Eve:	Something wrong? (He's visibly squirming, something must have happened...)
                Me: 	No, no, all good, no.
                Me: 	Why do you ask? (She's reading me like an open book, I need to end this conversation before she puts two and two together.)
                Eve:	I don't know, you seem distracted. (A lot of thoughts on your mind, huh?)
                Me: 	Anyway, I found your phone in the office... Under the desk...
                Me: 	While cleaning... (White lies, white lies, white lies...)
                Eve:	So that's where it was. (Wait, no he didn't...)
                Eve:	(Is that why he's so nervous? Because he snooped through my phone and saw the photos?)
                Eve:	(Is this erection because of me?)
                Me: 	I-I gotta go now. See ya' later!
                Narr:	Unexpectedly, Eve hugs you and gives you a kiss on the cheek.
                Eve:	Thanks for being such a hard worker, I appreciate it. (He got hard after seeing my naughty gallery, I'm sure of it!)
                Eve:	(His hard dick says it all...)
                Eve:	(Honestly, I find that quite interesting.)
                Eve:	(I can barely bring myself to admit it, but... i-it's actually a turn-on...)
                Eve:	(I wish I could touch it, at least once.)
                Eve:	Hmm... (Maybe I can, at least a little bit...)
                Eve:	I'll see you later, then. I still have some things to do.
                Me: 	(Belle's obviously pulling my leg, anyway.)
                Me: 	(She's so full of shit...)
                Me: 	*Chuckle* (The pictures on my phone are far worse than this.)
                Me: 	(Whatever, I've seen enough...)
                Narr:	Locking the phone, you head for the door.
        Me: 	(Even though I'm curious... Not sure if I wanna know.)
        Me: 	(Plus, it's pretty shitty to invade someone's privacy like that.)
        Me: 	Fuck that. (I respect Eve too much.)
        Me: 	(I'm not lowering myself to Belle's level...)
        Narr:	You leave the office and continue walking down the hallway toward the house...
        Narr:	Along the way, you spot Eve coming in your direction...
        Eve:	Done cleaning?
        Me: 	All done.
        Eve:	Awww, thank you. (He's so reliable and sweet.)
        Eve:	You're such a hard worker.
        Me: 	*Chuckle* Quit it.
        Eve:	I need to get something from the office.
        Eve:	I'll see you later.
        Me: 	Wait, I almost forgot...
        Narr:	You hand Eve her phone.
        Me: 	I found it in the office while I was cleaning. (White lies, white lies...)
        Eve:	So that's where it was. Thanks. (This might be a problem.)
        Eve:	I hope you haven't been snooping through my phone.
        Me: 	No, of course not. (She looks serious.)
        Eve:	Well, that’s good. For a second there, you had me worried. *Chuckle* (Phew...)
        Me: 	(Interesting choice of words...)
        Eve:	Anyway, I'll be in the office if you need me.
        Me: 	Okay. (This is making me suspicious.)
        Me: 	(What if Belle's right?)
        Me: 	(Judging from Eve's reaction, that seems to be the case...)
        Me: 	(Damn, I should've looked for more evidence.)
        Me: 	...
        Me: 	(Although, this isn't that bad either...)
        Me: 	(Maybe I could've seen that thicc ass naked...)
        Me: 	(Ahh, fuck! Why do I keep fantasizing about her!? That's just so weird.)
Narr:	Walking through the house, you bump into Emily again...
    Me: 	Guess what? You lost. (And now to rub it in...)
    Emily:	Did I now? (Looks like he decided to put in the extra effort just to rub it in my face.)
    Me: 	It's not even afternoon, but I'm done with all the tasks.
    Me: 	Seems like I won our little bet.
    Emily:	I'll believe it when I see it.
    Me: 	Then go and take a look.
    Emily:	Maybe I will. *Chuckles*
    Me: 	"You WILL"? Did I hear that correctly?
    Me: 	It sounds like you're trying to back out.
    Emily:	Nothing wrong with checking to make sure you weren't cheating.
    Me: 	I always play fair.
    Emily:	We'll see...
    Emily:	Catch ya later, [m!t]!
    Me: 	(Shit, it's Emily.)
    Me: 	(I can already picture her face when she finds out she won...)
    Me: 	*Sigh* (Let's just get this over with.)
    Emily:	Something wrong?
    Me: 	Uhh, not really. (Wait for it, wait for it...)
    Emily:	You look all flustered, [m!t]. Hope you're not working too much.
    Narr:	Without saying another word, Emily continues on her trajectory.
    Me: 	(Did she just... Forget?)
    Me: 	(How could she forget!? I thought it would've been the highlight of her day...)
    Me: 	(I shouldn't get too complacent, she'll bring it up sooner or later, I can tell.)
    Me: 	*Sigh* Can't wait...
Narr:	As you leave the house, you hear the girls shouting and making noise.
Me: 	(They sound like they're having fun.)
Me: 	(I wonder what they're doing...)
Narr:	As you get closer, you notice the girls playing volleyball.
Naomi:	Alright Stacy, time to turn this around...
Belle:	Only thing that’s gonna turn is your head when the ball whooshes past it.
Violet:	HAH! Good one!
Violet:	I wonder if she'll get it over the net this time. *Chuckle*
svi Hahaha!
Naomi:	*Grunt* I'll show you...
Naomi:	DIE!
Me: 	(Wow, they sure are having fun...)
Violet:	Get it!
Belle:	Aye, aye!
Me: 	(And look, Belle's not naked anymore...)
Me: 	(Or, at least, not as much.)
Belle:	Whoops, sorry!
Violet:	Good enough!
Naomi:	Do NOT let the ball fall!
Stacy:	*Stare*
Violet:	KIAI!!!
Naomi:	*Grunts* Humpfff!
Me: 	(Wow, I didn't expect Naomi to give it her all...)
Naomi:	...
Me: 	(Even though she's getting wrecked.)
svi Wooo!
Naomi:	*Grunt*
Stacy:	Look.
Naomi:	[m!ut]!
Belle:	Ooohhh, a spectator!
Naomi:	Excellent, you're just in time...
Me: 	Time for what?
Naomi:	Volleyball, duuuuh.
Me: 	But it's two on two already. I'd just upset the balance.
Naomi:	And that's exactly what we need!
Me: 	I don't get it.
Belle:	*Chuckle* They're losing, like, forty to zero!
Naomi:	Shut up! You're not doing anything.
Belle:	Hahaha, that's what makes it even funnier!
Me: 	So, Violet's been destroying you?
Violet:	Hellooo.
Naomi:	Listen, [m!ct], I don't care about winning or anything. 
Naomi:	I just want to score at least one point against that gorilla. Just one.
Naomi:	I can't let her humiliate me like this.
svi Weeeee!
Me: 	*Chuckle* Forty to nothing does sting.
Naomi:	So, are you helping or not?
Me: 	Alright, I'll do it. Let me just get my shorts.
Naomi:	Great!
Narr:	You rush to your room and change into swimwear.
Narr:	As you return, Naomi notices you immediately.
Me: 	Ready.
Naomi:	Finally!
Naomi:	Stacy! Get off the stage!
Stacy:	Okay. May the flame spirit guide you.
Naomi:	*Scoff* She's such an airhead.
Me: 	Don't blame me if we lose.
Naomi:	Then I won't reward you if we win. *Wink*
Me: 	*Chuckle* Alright.
Violet:	Ready?
Me: 	Do it!
Violet:	Hummf...
Violet:	KIAI!
Me: 	Got it!
Naomi:	Smash it!
Me: 	HAAAA!
Violet:	Not on my watch!
Narr:	Violet blocks your killer shot...
Narr:	And Belle sets the ball up for Violet's spike...
Narr:	Just before she slams it back onto your side of the field, you and Naomi get ready to catch it.
Violet:	TAKE THIS!
Narr:	Both of you react as soon as possible...
svi I got it!
Narr:	Losing your balance, you slam into each other...
Narr:	The blow knocks you on the ground, and swipes Naomi's bikini off.
Narr:	She starts falling onto you before you could say anything or react.
Narr:	Her bare tit ends up in your mouth, pressed down on your face.
Narr:	You get a good taste of her nipple in that brief moment.
Narr:	It was enjoyable as much as it was surprising...
Belle:	Hahaha! Violet, look!
Belle:	[m!ct]'s being breastfed!
Violet:	*Chuckle* How embarrassing.
Violet:	(We scored, but it feels like Naomi won...)
Naomi:	S-S-Sorry...
Me: 	I'm sorry, it was a complete accident!
Belle:	I'm sure [m!ct]'ll want to play again tomorrow.
Belle:	*Wink* But he's definitely playing on my team.
Naomi:	*Silently* Fuck this... (This is so humiliating.)
Narr:	Clutching her breasts firmly, Naomi gets up and starts leaving.
Me: 	Hey, where ya' going?
Naomi:	Anywhere but here!
Me: 	Naomi, come on...
Belle:	Just leave her. She'll get over it.
Violet:	Talk about touchy...
Me: 	I can't leave her like this, I feel bad.
Violet:	It's not your fault, she's the one who can't take a joke.
Belle:	Yeah, you should stay and have fun with us.
Belle:	Stacy can play again.
Belle:	Isn't that right, Stacy?
Stacy:	Huh?
Me: 	I'm sorry, but it wouldn't feel right.
Me: 	I'll go and try to talk to her.
Narr:	Determined, you follow Naomi back to her cabin...
Belle:	Now we're disappointed. BOOO!
Violet:	Tsk, playing favorites...
Narr:	Ignoring the other girls, you leave and head to Naomi's cabin.
Me: 	Naomi? It's me.
Me: 	Can I come in?
Me: 	...
Me: 	(Is she sulking so much she won't even talk to me?)
Me: 	Listen, I'm sorry for what happened.
Naomi:	What are you sorry for? It was an accident.
Me: 	I don't know. The girls were teasing you, and you didn't like it...
Me: 	I just couldn't let you leave in such a bad mood.
Narr:	You could clearly see the surprise on Naomi's face after hearing your words.
Naomi:	(He's worried about me? No one's ever worried about me.)
Naomi:	(It feels kinda nice... Warm.)
Me: 	Can I come in?
Narr:	Naomi weighs her options for a second...
Naomi:	Come in.
Narr:	Before letting you in.
Me: 	So, what was all that about?
Naomi:	They kept trash-talking...
Me: 	They were just teasing you, Naomi. They didn't mean anything by it.
Me: 	It's just the competitive spirit of sport, that's all.
Naomi:	I'm aware...
Me: 	Then why did you run away?
Naomi:	I didn't run away!
Naomi:	I just couldn't listen to it anymore...
Naomi:	It brings back bad memories.
Me: 	What memories?
Naomi:	You really want to know?
Me: 	Yeah, I wouldn't ask otherwise.
Naomi:	Hmm, you're full of surprises, [m!ct].
Naomi:	*Sigh* If you must know...
Naomi:	They remind me of my mom.
Me: 	Did she do something to you?
Naomi:	Yeah, you could say that.
Naomi:	She's the reason I'm in this shithole...
Naomi:	No offense.
Me: 	None taken.
Naomi:	I did something stupid...
Naomi:	And... Let's just say I went against her wishes.
Naomi:	She threw me to the wolves so she could keep sailing around on yachts drinking champagne and sucking dick.
Naomi:	Fucking bitch, I'll never forgive her.
Me: 	I still don't see what that has to do with Violet or Belle. (Her mom sounds like some high-end prostitute...)
Naomi:	My mother doesn't have a very high opinion of me...
Naomi:	And she makes damn sure I don't forget that.
Me: 	Wow, that's harsh. Sorry to hear it... (And a bitch, to boot.)
Naomi:	*Sigh* It's fine.
Naomi:	I stopped listening to her when I was fourteen.
Me: 	Then, don't listen to the girls' trash-talk.
Me: 	They're just having fun, and I'm sure they want you to be a part of it, too.
Naomi:	Yeah, I guess you're right...
Narr:	Your efforts reveal a gentle smile on Naomi's lips.
Narr:	There was a brief moment of honesty, of appreciation...
Naomi:	Sooo...
Naomi:	Wanna suck on my tits some more?
Me: 	*Chuckle* That's the Naomi I know.
Me: 	Maybe some other time.
Naomi:	*Chuckle*
Naomi:	I will hold you to that.
Me: 	Alright, let's find the rest.
Naomi:	You go on ahead, I'll catch up.
Me: 	Okay, don't leave us hanging.
Narr:	Leaving the cabin, you look for the girls...
Narr:	As you approach the lake, you spot them hanging out on the dock.
Me: 	(There they are.)
Narr:	They wave you over.
Me: 	(Guess it's not all that bad, being here at the camp...)
Me: 	(I'm having fun with beautiful women every day...)
Me: 	(Even though they all have a few screws lose.)
Violet:	So, how'd it go?
Me: 	It went well. She said she'll join us soon.
Belle:	Well, I'm not waiting for her... it's fucking hot.
Stacy:	I'm good.
Belle:	Of course YOU'RE good. You probably bathe in fire every day.
Stacy:	Not every day...
Belle:	I rest my case.
Me: 	What are we doing anyway?
svi SWIMMING!
Me: 	*Chuckle* Wouldn't mind going for a swim, yeah.
Belle:	I'm diving in! Later, nerds!
Narr:	Belle's closest to the edge, so she jumps into the lake first.
Stacy:	Me next!
Narr:	Stacy pinches her nose, closes her eyes...
Narr:	And clumsily throws herself off the pier.
Belle:	Ahhhh, cold, liquid bliss...
Violet:	Wanna go next?
Stacy:	COOOOLD!
Me: 	Go ahead.
Violet:	Alright.
Narr:	Violet takes a running start...
Narr:	And catapults herself off the pier...
Narr:	Gracefully swan-diving into the lake.
Me: 	(Damn, sick jump.)
Belle:	Hmm? (Hey, that's Violet's bikini!)
Belle:	Stacy, come take a look at this...
Stacy:	Is that a bikini?
Belle:	*Chuckle* It's Violet's bikini.
Stacy:	I'm sure it's very freeing. I think I'll..
Belle:	Wait! Before you whip your tits out again...
Belle:	I think I have an idea. Follow my lead.
Belle:	Wooow, Violet. That was such a cool jump.
Belle:	Can you do it again?
Stacy:	(I see...)
Stacy:	Yes, may you show us again? It looked wondrous.
Violet:	Really? Okay, I'll dive in again.
Violet:	Just give me a second.
svi *Giggling*
Me: 	(What are they talking about?)
Narr:	Violet's feet touch the bottom, and she starts walking towards the shore...
Narr:	Unaware that her bare tits are slowly emerging from the water, as well.
Narr:	Giving everyone an opportunity to get a better look.
Me: 	(She has no top on!)
Me: 	(Damn... Violet has some serious knockers.)
svi Hahahaha!
Violet:	What are you laughing at?
Belle:	Aren't you missing something?
Violet:	What, I'm just wearing--
Violet:	EEEEEEK!
Me: 	*Chuckle* Sorry...
Me: 	(Those two are losing their minds.)
Me: 	(Fuck, I'm hard again...)
Me: 	(Lake, shield my raging boner!)
Narr:	You dive in the water, joining the girls.
Me: 	*Inhale*
Belle:	Oh, hello. When did you pop up?
Me: 	I was eager to cool myself off.
Belle:	Were you now? (I wonder if Violet caused a reaction...)
Belle:	Let me check something out...
Narr:	Belle firmly grabs your underwater hard-on.
Me: 	Hey, what are you doing!?
Belle:	*Giggle* I knew it! You got hard!
Me: 	Stop it, I'll drown--
Belle:	Stacy, come look at this!
Violet:	*In the distance* Can you give me back my top?
Stacy:	What?
Belle:	Come, give me your hand.
Stacy:	Huh, what for?
Violet:	*In the distance* Guuuys, hellooo!?
Me: 	*Inhale* Belle! *Gurgle*
Belle:	Wanna touch [m!ct]'s dick?
Stacy:	Hmm...
Stacy:	Why not?
Narr:	You resurface for air just as Belle lets go of your hard-on.
Narr:	Only to be pulled down by Stacy instead.
Stacy:	By the Fiery Lord! 
Stacy:	What beast lies in these murky depths!?
Me: 	*Gurgle* Damn... you... both...
Me: 	Let go... of my... DICK!
svi Hahahaha!
Violet:	What's going on over here?
Belle:	Violet, come check this out!
Stacy:	You won't believe it.
Me: 	No way! (Fuck this, abort mission!)
Belle:	Hey, where are you going?
Narr:	You start swimming away from the girls...
Narr:	Hoping you'd get to shore before they got to you.
Me: 	(Crazy bitches started grabbing my junk out of nowhere.)
Me: 	(Almost drowned me!)
Me: 	(I need to get to shore.)
Me: 	(Just a bit further...)
Narr:	Now, only inches from the shore, something firmly grabs your ankle.
Me: 	(What the fu--)
Narr:	In the moment, you don't know if you're entangled in kelp...
Narr:	Or if there's truly a beast in the murky depths.
Me: 	BWAAAH!
Violet:	Where are you going?
Belle:	*In the distance* Good job, Violet! Now keep him there!
Me: 	God dammit, Violet. How can you be so strong!?
Me: 	That's cheating! You're fuckin' overpowered!
Violet:	*Chuckle* I'll take that as a compliment.
Narr:	Seconds later, Belle and Stacy reach you...
Belle:	Thought you could get away from us, did you?
Stacy:	Embrace your destiny.
Me: 	If it weren't for Violet, I would have left you in my wake.
Belle:	We're a team, silly. Violet's the tank...
Violet:	Hey!
Belle:	I'm the AD carry and Stacy's...
Stacy:	*Stare*
Belle:	Support?
Stacy:	I help.
Me: 	Congratulations, "Charlie's Angels," you cornered me. Now what?
Violet:	Yeah, now what? Why did I have to swim after him?
Narr:	Without explanation, Belle grabs Violet's arm...
Narr:	And presses it down, onto your crotch.
Violet:	That's...
Violet:	EEEEEK!
Violet:	N-No! I can't do this...
Belle:	It's your fault, you know?
Violet:	...
Belle:	What a scaredy-cat...
Stacy:	*Meow*
Narr:	Out of nowhere, Naomi shows up.
Naomi:	What's with all this noise? What are you guys doing?
Belle:	[m!ct]'s got a boner, and we're checking it out.
Naomi:	Seriously!?
Stacy:	It's remarkable, really.
Naomi:	HOLD HIM DOWN! I'll be right there!
Belle:	Oh, I don't think he's going anywhere.
Narr:	Belle's iron grip tightens around your shaft...
Me: 	Haah, HAAA! PAIN!
Me: 	NOT GOING ANYWHERE, I GET IT!
Narr:	Smiling menacingly, she keeps holding you down by holding your cock...
Me: 	(How the fuck did I get myself into this!?)
Me: 	(Hot, crazy, bitches are grabbing my cock. One after another...)
Me: 	(Under different circumstances, this would be a dream come true. But now...)
Naomi:	Is it still hard?
Belle:	Rock-hard. *Chuckle*
Naomi:	OooOoooh! I want to touch it too!
Naomi:	Out of the way!
Belle:	HEY!
Me: 	*Yeah, help yourself. You don't want to be the only one left out.*
Naomi:	Don't mind me...
Naomi:	Oh, wow! This is an unexpected surprise...
Naomi:	A very long, thick, and hard surprise.
Belle:	Let me feel it again!
Naomi:	You got your chance!
Belle:	*Grunt* I was KIND enough to LET YOU...
Naomi:	You don't own his dick, bitch!
Me: 	None of you do!
Me: 	Now get the hell off of me! Both of you!
Narr:	You quickly move away from the girls, leaving them in their lust.
Me: 	(What the hell is wrong with them!? They started grabbing my dick out of nowhere!)
Me: 	(Just fucking great... Another thing I have to keep secret from Jane.)
Naomi:	Think we overdid it?
Belle:	...
svi Naaah...
Narr:	After the lake fiasco, you return to your room and, soon, evening comes...
Me: 	*Sigh* Sweet solitude.
Me: 	(Today was... Sexually charged, to say the least...)
Me: 	(I had, like, five erections and I didn't even think of sex or anything...)
Me: 	(Shit just kept happening to me!)
Me: 	(I should keep quiet about everything. Don't want any rumors spreading.)
Me: 	(Or any unwanted ears hearing them...)
Me: 	(Especially Jane.)
Me: 	OH, FUCK! JANE! (I forgot! I completely forgot about her!)
Me: 	(I need to text her right away, or she'll flip again.)
Me: 	Come on, come on... (The sooner I text her, the better.)
Me: 	"Hey, sexy, what's up?"
Me: 	*Sigh* Nothing special, but that should do it.
Narr:	Nervously, you wait for an answer...
Narr:	Focusing your gaze on the phone screen like you're trying to burn a hole in it.
Narr:	Luckily for you, it doesn't take long for Jane to answer.
Jane:	"Oh, look, he remembers!"
Me: 	"I was busy until now..." (Fuck, she can see right through me.)
Jane:	"Thank you for finding time for me in your busy schedule."
Me: 	"Jane, come on... We did this bit yesterday..."
Jane:	"Chill, chill. I'm just messing with you. Tee-hee."
Me: 	"Please don't, my little heart can't take any more excitement for today."
Me: 	(IDIOT! Now she's bound to ask questions!)
Jane:	"How come? What happened?"
Me: 	(There you go...)
Me: 	(I don't like it, but I'll have to lie my way out of this one...)
Me: 	(I mean, it's not like I cheated on her... They're the ones constantly hitting on me.)
Me: 	(Yeah, it's not my fault! But, still...)
Me: 	(I'll have to come up with something believable.)
Narr:	With great care, you write the next few messages...
Narr:	Trying to sound plausible, but also trying not to let any touchy info leak out.
Narr:	Telling her more about how you're spending your days here...
Narr:	All the while leaving out all the juicy, yet volatile, details.
Narr:	You and Jane keep chatting for a while, before Eve comes knocking on your door...
Me: 	Come in.
Eve:	Hey, have a minute?
Me: 	Yeah, what's up?
Eve:	Come with me.
Narr:	You get up and follow Eve...
Me: 	So, what did you need me for?
Eve:	The girls and I are going grocery shopping.
Eve:	I'd like you to prep the camping spot, get a fire going, and entertain the patients.
Me: 	*Sigh* Can't they entertain themselves?
Eve:	Oh, come now. It's not that bad.
Eve:	You get to hang out with pretty girls.
Me: 	Pretty unstable girls.
Eve:	[m!ct]...
Me: 	I'm joking, I'm joking... I'll do it.
Eve:	I knew I could count on you.
Me: 	*Chuckle* Always.
Eve:	Awww...
Narr:	She gently caresses her cheek and smiles.
Narr:	A smile you always found heartwarming.
Eve:	Come, now. We're in somewhat of a hurry.
Narr:	With that settled, you follow Eve outside...
Me: 	What do you need Emily and Kiara for, anyway?
Eve:	They said they wanted to stretch their legs.
Me: 	Maybe I wanna stretch my legs? Nobody bothered to ask me?
Eve:	You'll get your chance.
Eve:	But right now, I really need someone to make sure this place stays in one piece.
Eve:	And who better to ask than you?
Me: 	*Scoff* Yeah, I'm great...
Eve:	*Chuckle* That's why I asked.
Me: 	But, Kiara or Emily...
Me: 	I haven't even seen them interact with the patients once.
Me: 	What are they doing here, anyway?
Eve:	Kiara's a veteran, so she gets special treatment.
Me: 	And Emily?
Eve:	Emily is young and... difficult to handle.
Eve:	Please, you're the only one I can count on.
Me: 	Already told you, I'll do it. 
Me: 	I was just wondering if I drew the short straw.
Eve:	Don't assume we're slacking off.
Eve:	Everyone works as hard as they can.
Eve:	Ladies! I'm back! Can I borrow all of you for a second!?
Narr:	Not long after being called out, the girls gather around Eve again...
Eve:	Excellent, everyone's here.
Eve:	So, I have some errands to run. [m!ct] will keep an eye on all of you.
Eve:	We were hoping you ladies could fix up the camping spot out back, a little.
Belle:	Sure, I'm down.
Violet:	Me too.
Stacy:	Can we make a fire?
Eve:	Well, it is a camping spot...
Stacy:	YES!
Naomi:	Umm, hello, Naomi here... Why exactly should we work?
Naomi:	We came here for "rehabilitation", not calluses.
Eve:	Because this IS rehabilitation.
Eve:	You need to start doing normal things, like maintenance.
Eve:	You might find it boring--
Naomi:	I already do...
Eve:	But the grim reality is that you won't be able to do whatever you please, whenever it suits you...
Eve:	And I'm not just talking about our time together.
Stacy:	Reality IS difficult...
Naomi:	What?
Eve:	Lack of stimulation, and boredom, can be a strain on an unhealthy mentality.
Eve:	Why don't you at least give it a go?
Naomi:	*Sigh* Well, you asked so nicely...
Eve:	That's the spirit!
Eve:	Alright, I have to go. Take care, everyone.
Eve:	See you soon.
Narr:	Eve goes away and leaves you to hang out with the girls.
Me: 	(This'll be fun...)
Belle:	You're a good, obedient, little boy, huh?
Naomi:	You do everything she asks of you?
Stacy:	He'd be a good follower.
Violet:	Come on, I think it's sweet.
Me: 	You done?
Belle:	Just about.
Belle:	But you can't really blame [m!ct]...
Belle:	Even I could never say no to those massive, milky tits of hers!
Me: 	...
Belle:	Okay, now I'm done.
Me: 	Great, let's get this over with...
Narr:	Not long after...
Me: 	I'll bring us some fresh logs to sit on.
Me: 	Can you get rid of the old ones?
Violet:	Of course.
Belle:	I'll help too.
Naomi:	If I break a nail, I'll have your head.
Me: 	Stacy, you?
Stacy:	I mean, I can...
Me: 	Oh, I know what you'd like...
Me: 	Why don't you get us some firewood?
Narr:	Your suggestion makes Stacy's eyes sparkle...
Narr:	And, she runs off with a smile to get something flammable.
Naomi:	The simplicity of that girl...
Belle:	Mind-boggling.
Me: 	Ready to have "fun"?
Violet:	Yes!
Belle:	Wooo, party!
Naomi:	*Sigh* Let's get this over with...
Narr:	You begin freshening up the spot...
Narr:	And, after a while, it actually looks a bit more presentable.
Naomi:	Is it just me, or does everything look exactly the same?
Belle:	Yeah, I don't see any difference.
Naomi:	So all of this effort was for nothing?
Stacy:	How can you call this majestic fire "nothing"?
Violet:	I think it's great.
Narr:	You all share a brief moment of silence, as no one has anything more to really say.
Narr:	But, soon...
Belle:	I'm bored out of my miiiiiiind!
Naomi:	Yeah, this is horrible.
Stacy:	I agree. It's just not the same without chicken blood...
Me: 	I can bring us some marshmallows if you want?
Naomi:	Yeah, that'll liven up the mood.
Me: 	Anyone? Violet?
Violet:	No thanks, that's too much sugar.
Me: 	Then I guess we'll just sit in silence...
Belle:	Wanna get drunk?
Stacy:	Yes!
Naomi:	Why, you have something?
Belle:	Maybe... *Giggle*
Me: 	You're lying. I checked your things, and there wasn't any booze.
Narr:	Belle slyly smiles...
Belle:	"BRB"!
Narr:	And leaves the campfire.
Violet:	Wonder what she'll come up with...
Me: 	So do I.
Naomi:	So does everyone... and, I seriously hope she comes back with a bottle of vodka.
Me: 	I think you're in for a disapp--
Belle:	Who wants vodkaaa!?
Me: 	You gotta be shitting me...
Naomi:	DIBS!
Violet:	Come on, you're not really gonna--
Stacy:	Me too, me too!
Naomi:	*Glug* *Glug*
Naomi:	Fuck yes! That hits the spot!
Me: 	How the hell did you smuggle a whole bottle of vodka onto camp?
Belle:	*Wink*
Me: 	*Shivers* Oh God...
Stacy:	Violet, have some.
Violet:	Hmm... Guess I could take a sip.
Me: 	"Et tu, Brute"?
Naomi:	Oh, leave her alone. She knows how to make her own choices.
Narr:	This sentence leaves everyone dumbfounded for a second.
Narr:	Finally, you're the first one who manages to come back to their senses...
Me: 	Naomi... Were you just nice to Violet?
Belle:	Yeah, I thought you couldn't stand each other.
Naomi:	Shut up!
Naomi:	We're not best buddies... but I guess I can respect her.
Violet:	Wow, I didn't expect that.
Violet:	Honestly... I respect you too, Naomi.
Naomi:	Don't think this means we're besties...
Violet:	*Chuckle* It's a start.
Violet:	Want some?
Me: 	I mean, if Violet's drinking, I guess I don't have an excuse not to.
Belle:	Woooo! GO, [m!tu]!
Stacy:	Best guardian ever!
Violet:	*Chuckle* Most handsome guardian.
Naomi:	And the size of his... Oof! *Shivers*
Me: 	Good thing I didn't confiscate that bottle, I’m not sure how I'd handle you girls otherwise.
Belle:	*Chuckle* Aww, [m!ct] likes us.
Me: 	I'm sorry, did you mishear me?
svi Hahahaha!
Narr:	The booze lifts everyone's spirits, naturally.
Narr:	And, after a while, everyone's nice and cozy...
Narr:	And tipsy...
Me: 	So, anyone have any good campfire stories they wanna share?
Me: 	Violet, I'm sure you have some stories to share.
Violet:	I don't know...
Belle:	Shyness is a sickness, you know?
Naomi:	And hyper-eroticism isn't?
Belle:	*Chuckle* Touché.
Narr:	Violet is still gazing at the stars, wondering which story to tell...
Violet:	I think I have one, but it's not that special.
Naomi:	Whatever, just entertain us.
Violet:	Okay, here goes nothing...
Violet:	Everyone's aware I've been into sports since I was a kid, right?
Violet:	My dad was a triathlete... a gold medalist might I add.
Violet:	He wanted me to follow in his footsteps...
Naomi:	Classic pushy parent?
Violet:	Not really. I mean, he is pushy...
Violet:	Anyway, my second trainer was this really nice guy, pretty famous too.
Violet:	He helped me out with everything.
Violet:	Making sure I'm healthy, and strong...
Violet:	Preparing me for competitions, and even training me outside working hours.
Naomi:	Was he handsome?
Violet:	He was quite good-looking. Very charming, too.
Belle:	Drool.
Violet:	*Chuckle* A bit.
Violet:	Everyone was quite infatuated with him, even my parents.
Me: 	I hear a "but" coming...
Violet:	But...
Me: 	Called it.
Violet:	Slowly, his affection started turning sour.
Violet:	I knew he found me attractive, but I didn't think he'd make a move.
Violet:	I was so young...
Belle:	How old were you back then?
Violet:	It was just after I turned eighteen.
Belle:	Tell us more!
Violet:	He started touching me more often, even though I told him it felt weird.
Violet:	He'd always pull back as soon as I said anything.
Violet:	But one day, in the lockers, he didn't...
Violet:	He kept flirting with me, trying to get me to say yes...
Violet:	But I wouldn't let up.
Violet:	He continued anyway.
Naomi:	Fuck, Violet, you got raped!?
Violet:	Oh, no, no.
Stacy:	What happened?
Violet:	I couldn't take it anymore, so I...
Violet:	Hit him.
Me: 	And what did he do?
Violet:	Honestly, I don't remember.
Violet:	I was seeing red, so everything is a bit blurry.
Violet:	But after all was said and done...
Violet:	He ended up in the hospital with a broken arm.
Violet:	Aaand his nose...
Violet:	Aaaaaand a few cracked ribs...
Violet:	They also had to buy new lockers.
Naomi:	Holy shit...
Me: 	*Chuckle* Violet, you're pretty badass.
Belle:	Nice, Violet!
Stacy:	Remind me to never make you angry. I don’t really need to go through a full facial reconstruction.
Violet:	*Chuckle* Thanks, guys.
Violet:	*Blush* Everyone else scolded me afterwards.
Violet:	Like, I was the one who went overboard.
Me: 	He should count himself lucky that he's alive.
Violet:	That's what I thought.
Naomi:	Wow, sorry for giving you so much shit, Violet.
Violet:	It's okay, apology accepted.
Belle:	*Chuckle* Naomi is just scared for her life.
Naomi:	Shut up.
Me: 	Belle, why don't you tell us a story?
Belle:	Me? You sure?
Belle:	'Kay, you asked for it...
Belle:	So...
Belle:	At one point in my life, I met this older, gorgeous, woman.
Belle:	Married, I might add.
Me: 	Oh God, I think I know where this is going...
Belle:	We weren't close or anything... We didn't even know each other that long.
Belle:	And, at one point, we found ourselves in a room together, just the two of us, alone...
Belle:	She was helping me out with something.
Belle:	And we talked about this and that...
Belle:	I gave her a few compliments, and she found them very flattering.
Belle:	She told me I was pretty...
Belle:	So I continued my advances.
Me: 	And what? You had sex?
Violet:	Shhh! She was just getting to the good part...
Stacy:	Continue.
Narr:	Everyone feels a hot tingling sensation, listening to Belle's story...
Narr:	And the further the story goes, the more focused everyone is.
Belle:	I began caressing her shoulder, and continued flirting with her.
Belle:	At first she was chuckling, like I was making it all up...
Belle:	Said she wasn't interested.
Belle:	But I was tenacious. I wanted her, so badly.
Belle:	So, there was only one thing I could do at this point...
Belle:	I kissed her on the lips.
Violet:	Were they soft? (Wait, why did I ask that? Everyone's going to think I'm weird now, for sure!)
Belle:	Oooh, you have no idea.
Belle:	At first, she looked shocked...
Belle:	But after a moment, she kissed me back.
Stacy:	Was there a fire near you?
Belle:	What? Fire? Why wou--
Belle:	*Sigh* Never mind.
Belle:	No, there was no fire.
Belle:	Anyway, one thing led to the next, and soon...
Belle:	I was sticking my tongue in her mouth, and grabbing her tits.
Belle:	She had these massive boobs you just wanted to drown yourself in.
Belle:	So bubbly and soft...
Naomi:	Yeah, yeah, perfect tits. Now get to the good part.
Belle:	She had this lovely dress, tight-fit.
Belle:	It made her curves look extra sensual...
Me: 	And?
Belle:	[m!ct]? Is that you showing interest?
Me: 	It's the vodka.
Belle:	*Chuckle* If you say so.
Belle:	So, the next thing...
Belle:	I slipped my hand under her skirt...
Belle:	And she let out the most erotic moan I've ever heard.
Stacy:	Would've been even better if there was a fire next to you, just saying...
Violet:	Stacy, shh!
Violet:	What happened next?
Me: 	(Wow, Violet's really into it, too.)
Belle:	I continued twisting my tongue around inside her mouth, while gently playing with her down there...
Belle:	Wanted to kiss and taste every inch of her body.
Belle:	She looked as if she felt the same.
Belle:	I was thinking how I wanted to lick her pussy clean and stick a dildo into all of her orifices.
Violet:	AND THEN?
Belle:	*Sigh* Unfortunately, it was cut short.
Violet:	Damn!
Naomi:	As expected. (Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little fun to listen to...)
Stacy:	Told ya'. If you had a flickering flame near you, good fortune would have followed.
Belle:	I know, right? Super anticlimactic.
Belle:	She had to be somewhere and couldn't risk getting caught.
Naomi:	Shame, she sounds lovely.
Belle:	She is... I'm in love.
Belle:	But, don't worry. I'll get into her pants eventually...
Me: 	Why am I not surprised?
Stacy:	Just light a fire next time before you start seducing her, trust me.
Violet:	If Belle's open-minded enough to try it with an older woman, she should.
Naomi:	I can't believe I'm saying this... but I'm actually a little jealous.
Me: 	I think we all are. *Chuckle*
Stacy:	Any other stories? Preferably involving fire, this time.
Me: 	Why don't you tell us a "fiery" story then, Stacy?
Stacy:	Sure, I have a few.
Stacy:	What kind of tale would you like to hear?
Violet:	Do you have any stories, or legends about your religion? I've never heard anything about it.
Stacy:	Of course! Hundreds!
Naomi:	"Hundreds"? Seriously?
Stacy:	Well, yeah. It's good practice...
Stacy:	It's also the best way to get the youth interested.
Stacy:	I guess since you're all Seed-level, I'll start with our creation story...
Naomi:	"Seed-Level"?
Me: 	I think she's calling us uninformed idiots.
Naomi:	Huh, annoying...
Stacy:	Don't worry, the moment you hear our creation story, you'll be leagues ahead of the rest of the world.
Belle:	Enough intro! I wanna hear what it's all about already.
Narr:	Stacy stands up and takes a deep breath...
Stacy:	In the beginning, there was only the void. Dark, and cold.
Stacy:	Endless, indifferent space...
Stacy:	Apeiron!
Stacy:	But this wouldn't last, at least not forever.
Stacy:	The void, Apeiron, at one point, became conscious...
Stacy:	And this consciousness was like a baby, a different entity.
Me: 	Heavenly-Phoenix Lotus?
Stacy:	You're rushing the story, [m!ct]...
Stacy:	Just 'cause you know parts of it, doesn't mean you should spoil it for the rest.
Narr:	Everyone slightly chuckles at her remark.
Me: 	Sorry...
Stacy:	Anyway, on the first "day," if you can even call it a day...
Stacy:	This new entity realized it was bored.
Stacy:	Just imagine an existence, submerged in eternal darkness.
Violet:	That sounds horrible...
Stacy:	It WAS horrible.
Stacy:	This entity was sick of being cold...
Stacy:	So it imagined what it would be like to not be cold.
Stacy:	It imagined the opposite of darkness...
Stacy:	Light!
Stacy:	Redness, flickering and movement!
Stacy:	It created its first spark...
Stacy:	A spark that would eventually grow and spread, lighting up the universe we live in.
Violet:	Awww, that sounds so poetic.
Stacy:	It is...
Stacy:	Without heat, without light, without movement... nothing can exist.
Stacy:	So, the entity grew, and built its first world...
Stacy:	Dimension, if you will, for the science freaks among you.
Me: 	Thanks...
Stacy:	This was its home.
Stacy:	The first of the worlds!
Belle:	What's it like there?
Stacy:	It's divine. Always warm, always light...
Stacy:	Cinders fly like birds...
Stacy:	Flowers smell like flames.
Naomi:	Sounds like Hell, if you ask me.
Stacy:	It's a place we followers strive to get to.
Me: 	So, like, your version of Heaven?
Stacy:	Yeah, I guess it's something like that.
Belle:	What happened next?
Stacy:	Well, trouble, as you can imagine.
Stacy:	Darkness might not be conscious, but it still holds power over everything.
Stacy:	And it "wants" only one thing...
Stacy:	To consume and snuff out everything else.
Stacy:	So, in order to fight for its existence, our flaming entity continued to grow and create worlds.
Stacy:	Every sun, every fire, every heartbeat is an extension of our Lord.
Stacy:	But fighting the void is almost certainly a lost cause.
Stacy:	You can't stop it, you can't run away from it...
Stacy:	And, at one point, our Lord was extinguished by the darkness.
Naomi:	So we're all destined to perish, and descend into cold nothingness? Even if you're a godlike being?
Stacy:	Yes...
Violet:	I don't like the sound of that.
Stacy:	But, don't you see? The entity revived.
Stacy:	It couldn't be snuffed out, because of one sole reason...
Stacy:	It swore to itself, and to all creation...
Stacy:	That it would protect us from the darkness.
Stacy:	Eternity wouldn't stop it.
Stacy:	And then, after three eons, as it rose from its ashes, it adorned itself in the colors of flames, and took up a name...
Stacy:	"The Heavenly-Phoenix Lotus"!
Stacy:	Pure will, incarnate, the unfettered desire to live!
Stacy:	And, that's why, if you look deeply into yourself...
Stacy:	You'll find the same will and desire burning within each of us.
Naomi:	Since we're its extension?
Stacy:	Exactly.
Belle:	Woooow...
Violet:	*Sniff* It's so bittersweet.
Me: 	And what now? Today? In this era.
Stacy:	It's the same as always...
Stacy:	Live with a burning will, or perish into cold nothingness...
Me: 	Huh, tough times...
Me: 	Aaanyway...
Me: 	Naomi? Everyone else told a story... You got any of your own?
Naomi:	Don't people usually tell horror stories around campfires?
Me: 	I guess so.
Naomi:	So, how about a horror story, but one that actually happened?
Stacy:	Yes, please!
Violet:	I'm already getting the shivers.
Belle:	Try us.
Naomi:	You have a phone, right?
Me: 	Yeah. What for?
Naomi:	Give it here.
Me: 	*Scoff* No way, you'll snoop around my private life.
Naomi:	Oh, please. Like I care about your girlfriend.
Naomi:	Just give me the damn phone. You'll get it back, I promise.
Me: 	I know I'll regret this...
Narr:	You lend Naomi your phone.
Narr:	Taking it, she turns on the flash and points it up toward her chin...
Narr:	Making her face look sort of scary and warped.
Naomi:	This is an old story my grandma used to tell me.
Naomi:	In Wisconsin, when she was young, they lived on a farm...
Naomi:	Every day was full of work, but the days were rather tranquil.
Naomi:	No murders, no robberies, no nothing.
Naomi:	The only troublesome character that lived in their area was a hunter by the name of Hector.
Naomi:	Hector was what you'd call "an asshole."
Naomi:	He generally kept to himself, but sometimes he'd get in fights with other people.
Naomi:	And, always for the same reason...
Stacy:	Why did they fight?
Naomi:	Because of the drastic decline in the wildlife population ever since he arrived.
Me: 	So, he killed for sport?
Naomi:	Correct!
Naomi:	You see, Hector was a pretty good hunter, but a pretty horrible human being.
Naomi:	He had... tendencies.
Me: 	Yeah? What kind?
Naomi:	My grandma told me...
Naomi:	Sometimes, every few weeks or so, they'd hear the cries of beasts.
Naomi:	Not cries like when animals want to fuck, or compete to see who'll fuck...
Naomi:	But unnatural, ear-piercing screams of agony that would keep you up all night.
Naomi:	Like damned spirits, bound in perpetual torture...
Stacy:	Hey! I already used that kind of metaphor!
Naomi:	You don't own the English language, Stacy...
Violet:	That's horrible.
Belle:	Well, it IS a horror story.
Naomi:	The next morning, all was quiet.
Naomi:	The hunter returned with his handful of meat.
Naomi:	Pieces of deer, always cut to size, and always a small amount.
Naomi:	Only, she said his meat tasted funny... 
Naomi:	No pun intended.
Naomi:	Then, one day, as she was playing around the forest with her friends...
Naomi:	They got a whiff of an inexplicable and unbearable stench.
Stacy:	Was it poo?
Naomi:	No, it was not poo! It was WORSE!
Violet:	*Gasp*
Stacy:	What smells worse than poo?
Naomi:	How about a wretched mass of bloody, rotting, and unrecognizable corpses?
Violet:	Eww, I'm definitely going to puke.
Naomi:	She said she saw hooves, antlers and rib cages.
Naomi:	Crushed, and broken... All lumped together.
Naomi:	It was scarring... Trully the stuff of nightmares.
Naomi:	My grandma knew immediately...
Naomi:	She knew Hector was the one who did it. There was no doubt in her mind.
Violet:	Please tell me this has a happy ending?
Naomi:	Hah. I'll make sure to describe the gore in extra detail, just for you.
Violet:	*Sigh*
Naomi:	Anyway, she ran back home to tell her parents what she saw.
Naomi:	They believed her, but by the time she told them everything, it was already dark.
Naomi:	So, they decided to wait until morning.
Naomi:	But, suddenly...
Naomi:	*Inhuman screech*
Violet:	EEEEEEEK!
Naomi:	The screams, they could hear the screams again.
Naomi:	But... they were different, more shrill, more horrible than ever before.
Naomi:	Like hundreds of tortured voices screaming in agony.
Naomi:	Followed by loud thuds, like steps. Trees started to fall...
Naomi:	And then...
Naomi:	Another voice was heard, a human voice.
Naomi:	Which slowly morphed into this gurgling, howling scream, louder than ever before.
Naomi:	My grandma was shaking like a leaf. Her parents tried calming her throughout the night...
Naomi:	Once morning came, they walked down to the trail to the hunter's cottage.
Naomi:	My grandma led them to the pile of corpses, but when they got there...
Naomi:	There was nothing to be found.
Naomi:	Just a trail of fallen trees and blood.
Naomi:	You can guess where the trail led...
Me: 	Hector's cabin?
Naomi:	*Nod* At this point, grandma knew what happened even before they even got to his place.
Naomi:	And once they did, well...
Belle:	What!? What happened!? (Why am I so interested in this gory story?)
Naomi:	The first thing they noticed was Hector's cabin, crushed as if a tree fell on it.
Naomi:	But there was no tree trunk in sight.
Naomi:	The next thing that caught their attention... were the scattered remains, reduced to a bloody mess.
Stacy:	Oh, no...
Naomi:	Oh, yes!
Naomi:	They were Hector's remains, scattered and strewn across the vicinity.
Naomi:	His skull crushed in the dirt... his entrails hanging on nearby branches.
Naomi:	A bit of Hector here, a bit of Hector there...
Naomi:	There was nothing to be done.
Naomi:	He was gone, and so was his home.
Naomi:	So, they collected all the bits and pieces of Hector that they could find, and set them ablaze, along with his cottage.
Stacy:	FIRE ONE, HECTOR ZERO!
Naomi:	*Clears throat*
Naomi:	And now, today...
Naomi:	Almost fifty years later... My grandma's blood still runs cold when she talks about it.
Violet:	Horrible...
Belle:	But you haven't told us what happened with the pile of corpses.
Me: 	It was probably eaten by wildlife or something.
Naomi:	I told you, all the wildlife was nearly gone because of Hector.
Naomi:	Nothing could've eaten a "mound" of flesh without letting anything go to waste.
Naomi:	The worst part of this story is that they never found the corpses my grandma was looking for...
Naomi:	As soon as she was a bit older, she moved away from that place.
Naomi:	Told me it gave her the creeps.
Naomi:	Whatever it was that got Hector that night, it disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again.
Violet:	*Shiver*
Belle:	That... was actually super creepy.
Stacy:	Naomi is creepy...
Naomi:	I don't want to hear that from you!
Me: 	Not bad, but it's still just a story.
Naomi:	I told you, this happened.
Me: 	Can I have my phone back?
Naomi:	Everything I told you is exactly how my grandma used to tell me.
Me: 	Maybe she just wanted to scare you?
Naomi:	Maybe... But, I think, that shambling horror is still out there.
Naomi:	Punishing hunters that go too far...
Violet:	Guys, the fire is going out. Should we call it a night?
Naomi:	Fear of the dark?
Violet:	Don't be ridiculous...
Me: 	It's still pretty early, all we need is more wood.
Me: 	Any volunteers?
Narr:	After a moment of silence...
Me: 	Thought so.
Me: 	Then I'll go get some. Be right back.
Naomi:	Wait, [m!ct]! That's how all horror stories begin! The protagonists split up!
Me: 	If I'm not back within fifteen minutes, consider me murdered by some weird, shambling abomination.
Stacy:	Sounds fair.
Violet:	Shouldn't we go with him? It's pretty dark out.
Belle:	It's his backyard, he'll be fine.
Naomi:	Maybe Hector pops up to hunt and torture him.
Violet:	Oh, no...
Violet:	Be careful, [m!ct]!
Narr:	With that, you leave to get some more wood...
Me: 	("Be careful"... Did she really buy Naomi's story?)
Me: 	(It's just a story... What's got them shaking in their boots so much?)
Me: 	...
Me: 	*Chuckle* (I mean, if it's a massive lump of rotting flesh that's after me, I could probably outrun it.)
Me: 	Ah! (Some more wood!)
Me: 	(Fuck, it really is almost pitch black. I can barely see shit in front of me.)
Me: 	(What's making so much noise!?)
Me: 	Hello? Girls?
Me: 	...
Me: 	(Probably a squirrel or some shit.)
Me: 	*Chuckle* (I actually got scared there for a second.)
Me: 	(Naomi and her silly...)
Me: 	*Gasp* (WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!?)
Me: 	(I've never heard anything like it!)
Me: 	AAAH! FUUUUCK!!! (It's the monster!)
Me: 	(HECTOR'S ABOMINATION IS AFTER ME!)
Me: 	(Run, run, run! Just RUN!)
Me: 	(Holy shit, it's going to crush me!)
Me: 	(It's going to tear me apart!)
Me: 	(It's going to massacre me!)
Me: 	(Keep running, FASTER!)
Me: 	*Grunt* (Fucking branches, fucking darkness!)
Me: 	THERE! (The house! I can see the house!)
Me: 	(I can make it!)
Me: 	*Gasp* (It's right behind me!)
Me: 	(Just a bit furthe--)
Me: 	Ughhhhh...
Me: 	My head...
Me: 	(Where am I? It's so dark.)
Me: 	(Something's covering my eyes...)
Me: 	Huh? (I'm tied down!)
Me: 	(I was in the forest... Collecting wood, and...)
Me: 	(Something came after me.)
Me: 	(I ran, and... I don't remember!)
Me: 	(I thought that monster was gonna get me.)
Me: 	(But why am I tied down?)
Me: 	(Holy shit, was it Hector, the hunter?)
Me: 	AHHH! HECTOR!
Me: 	Stay away from me, you freak!
Me: 	If you hurt me, I'll hurt you! I SWEAR!
Me: 	I'm warning you!
Narr:	Suddenly, you feel a hand on your leg.
Narr:	Scared shitless, you barely notice that the touch is gentle and warm...
Narr:	Definitely not the touch of an evil hunter, or his monster.
Narr:	The hand caresses your leg.
Narr:	It travels further up...
Narr:	Until it grabs your crotch.
Narr:	And starts stroking you over your clothes.
Narr:	Until it unbuckles your pants...
Narr:	And takes them off, leaving your manhood exposed.
noname *Mmm...*
Me: 	(A woman?)
Me: 	(It must be one of the girls!)
Me: 	Ladies, you didn’t have to tie me up...
Narr:	A hand grabs your dick with determination.
Narr:	And starts stroking...
Me: 	(One of them is jerking me off!?)
Me: 	I know you're cock-hungry, but this is just obsessive overkill.
Me: 	I mean, I'm tied to a tree! There was no need for that.
Narr:	As the hand continues jerking you off, your dick becomes rock-hard quite quickly.
Me: 	*Pant* (Fuck... This feels pretty damn good.)
Me: 	Damn girl, you’re too good at this.
Narr:	You can feel the grip tighten as the hand pumps your cock even harder.
Me: 	*Groan* Fuck...
Me: 	Don't stop...
Narr:	Suddenly, you feel something else on your tip...
Me: 	(Is that... A tongue!?)
Me: 	Ahhh... (She's licking my cock!)
Me: 	(I can't believe this is happening... Am I dreaming?)
Me: 	What are you waiting for? Too scared to put it in your mouth?
Narr:	Taking up the challenge, a different sensation envelops your cock...
Narr:	The mouth sucks you off gingerly, as a tongue coils around you.
Narr:	A pleasurable electricity shoots up through your body...
Me: 	(Oh, man... Whoever this is knows how to suck dick!)
Me: 	*Groan* You're making my mind melt...
Me: 	*Pant* Fuck, don't stop.
Me: 	Just keep sucking my dick like that.
Narr:	Your comments increase the enthusiasm of whoever was sliding your cock into their mouth...
Narr:	It continues... Every repetition going deeper than the last.
Narr:	Pulling more of your length inside, each time...
Narr:	Faster, and faster...
Me: 	Fuck, I can barely hold it anymore.
Me: 	*Grunt* You're gonna make me cum!
Narr:	You swear you can almost feel a smile on the mouth that's currently sucking you off as you say this...
Narr:	And, the mouth doesn't let up...
Narr:	This person wants every single drop of your hot cum inside their throat.
Me: 	*Pant* I’m gonna cum in your mouth! Hnnngh...
Me: 	*Groan* Here it comes!
Narr:	Your dick contracts, shooting out its first stream of cum, right into the mouth enveloping it.
Narr:	A second... then a third and a fourth...
Narr:	As you continue emptying your balls, the mouth keeps sucking you off, swallowing each load with dedication.
Narr:	Their lips, tightly sealed around your cock...
Narr:	Their hand, gripping your shaft.
Me: 	Oh, my God! You're too good at this...
Me: 	*Pant* You deserve an encore.
Narr:	The lips that haven't said a word this entire time slide along your whole length...
Narr:	Reaching the tip and releasing it with a loud slurping sound.
Narr:	At this point, your mind is almost completely blank. Unable to move, unable to see anything...
Narr:	Finally, you hear footsteps and the rustling of leaves.
Narr:	The person walks behind you and loosens the knots that held you down...
Narr:	Leaving before you gather your bearings, still enthralled by the experience.
Narr:	You wiggle a little, freeing one of your arms.
Me: 	*Sigh* I can finally remove this blindfold.
Me: 	(What was that!?)
Me: 	(And who was that...)
