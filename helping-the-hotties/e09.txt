        m "(Damn it, Violet. You and your athletic legs.)"
n "Violet pulls you toward her, her sudden bravery catching you off guard."
v "Hmmm."
n "She pulls you in, so forcefully, yet her embrace is tender and her kisses passionate, as she slips you her tongue."
n "You succumb and kiss her back with matching passion."
v "*Soft moan*"
n "Her naked body is grinding against yours, trapped in throes of lust. She feels you up, her hand sliding against your hard cock."

n "Just to make her point perfectly clear, she pulls off your pants."
v "I need your touch. I catch myself thinking about it way too often."
v "More than I would like to admit."
n "She takes your cock and starts stroking it, slowly picking up the pace."
m "*Pant* You're not alone in that."

v "*Moan* Mmmm."

v "*Quiet gasp* Aaaaaah"
m "Violet..."

m "Shiiiit."

n "Violet is baffled by your action. She is still slowly stroking your cock, unable to break her hold on you."
m "Don't get me wrong - I'm loving this. Being with you here, a beautiful woman in front of me, naked..."
m "But, like I told you, I came here to get you since all the others already left, and, if we're late, Eve might not take it so well."
m "I'd rather not piss her off."
m "(Or give her a reason to suspect I'm fooling around with patients.)"
n "She appears disappointed, but, suddenly, a smile lights up her face."
n "She pulls herself closer to you, and, with her hand still around your cock, starts stroking you faster."
n "She whispers into your ear..."
v "What if we make it quick?"
m "(Woah, Violet is really persistent.)"
m "(Where did that shy and timid girl go?)"
m "(I'm loving this side of her. I just hope she doesn't end up a sex fiend like Belle.)"

    v "Since we have to make it quick..."

    v "[m!ct]..."
    v "Ooooooooooh!"

    v "Uuuuhhhh."

    v "Mmmmm, keep going like this and it's gonna happen."

    v "Just like -"
    n "Violet's legs start trembling, the sensation traveling upwards."
    n "Soon her ass is jiggling and she's grinding her pussy against your face."
    v "- THAT!!"

    v "Please, put it inside!"
    m "You sure?"
    v "*Soft moan* Mmmmhmhh."

    m "Ghhhhhhhnghhh..."
    m "Fuck, you're gonna make me - "

    m "Fuck, I'm gonna cum really fast if you keep this up..."
    n "Violet suddenly slows down, letting your cock slowly slide out of her mouth as she gasps for air."
    n "A trail of saliva still connects her with the object of her desire."
    m "*Pant* Why'd you stop?"
    v "I'm not ready for you to be done."

n "Violet snuggles up to you and rests her head on your chest, caressing you."
n "You share a moment, lost in it for just a little while."
v "Okay... I'll go and change."
v "Meet you outside?"
m "Of course, I'm not going anywhere."

        m "A lot, I take it?"
        b "Yeah, and you know how many of them are actually good?"
        b "By that, I mean they don't use pre-recorded game footage or bots to secure their wins."
        n "You hear the sounds of fighting going on in the game, lasers pewing and minions dying."
        n "Before you can answer, Belle speaks again."
        b "You see, if you're a girl in the streaming community, your looks are far more important than your actual skill."
        m "That must be hard."
        b "It is. If you are not a sex object, most people won't even be interested."
        m "(Could this be the root of her issue?)"
        m "(Is Belle's condition the result of her forcing herself to appeal to the viewers for the sake of pursuing her passions?)"
        m "(Man, this runs deeper than I thought...)"
        n "In spite of the seriousness of the topic at hand, Belle's focus is entirely on the game."
        n "And not masking her true thoughts with hypersexualization."
        n "For the first time, it feels like you are talking to Belle. The {i}real{/i} Belle."
        m "I never had a clue what it's like to be a girl heavily invested in the gaming community."
        m "I sometimes play a game or two to pass the time."
        b "Yeah, but that's because you know what you want to do with your life, silly!"
        m "Something like that."
        b "Well, the moment I got my first console, I knew that this was what I wanted to do for a living."
        b "But you have to be very aware of your looks, there will always be girls that are sexier, with bigger boobs or asses."
        b "That's why, to succeed as a streamer AND a girl, you must know how to make use of the assets you have."
        b "That's why I'm the best! Because I'm not all talk."
        n "This is the only moment where Belle turns her head away from the screen, smirking."
        b "If I say I'm going to suck your cock, then I'm going to suck your cock."
        m "(Now that's the Belle I know.)"
        b "She bursts into laughter, as if all of this is just a big joke, then returns her focus to the screen."
        b "Aw, yeah! Flawless victory!"
        n "She exclaims so loudly that it jolts you a little bit."
        n "However, you canâ€™t help thinking how nice it is to see Belle so happy and in her element."
        b "Your turn now, handsome."
        m "Hey, who's the boss here? You or me?"
        b "That's so hot..."
        b "But, come on, play a game! I wanna see how you roll."
        n "You decide to indulge her, switching places with her on your desk chair."
        n "Belle remains by your side, arms folded as she looks over which champion you are about to pick."
        b "Zeemo? You're picking Zeemo? Interesting."
        m "What?!"
        b "Nothing, nothing... Just keep playing."
        n "As you wait in the lobby for the match to start, you observe Belle from the corner of your eyes."
        n "For the first time since she arrived, she's not looking at you like you're a piece of meat."
        n "She's far more focused on the game you're playing."
        n "The match starts and you ready yourself for the fight!"
        m "(I better not embarrass myself in front of Belle.)"
        m "(It's so unnerving to be watched by someone so good at the game.)"
            n "The gods of the game seem to be on your side today as you absolutely decimate your enemy."
            m "Yes, yes, YES!"
            b "Hey, that wasn't half bad!"
            b "I noticed some critical errors though, but you're pretty good for a casual player."
            b "You'd have no problem reaching my rank if you put in some effort."
            m "Thanks, but I mainly use this to unwind."
            b "You can unwind while playing League of Luminaries?"
            b "That game makes even the most steel-nerved of us lose our temper!"
            m "I know, I'm strange like that."
            b "Well, I'll make sure to give you a reward for your victory."
            m "What kind of reward?"
            b "I'll think of something."
            n "Luck is not on your side today, as the enemy pushes through your forts and absolutely decimates you."
            m "Man, it's whatever I guess..."
            b "Don't let them troll you! Type in the chat to your teammates that you would've won if they'd just stuck to their lanes."
            b "This always gets my blood boiling, how hard can it be to stick to one lane?!"
            m "It's alright Belle, it's not that big of a deal!"
            b "If it means anything, you are a victor in my eyes!"
            n "Belle moves to plant a kiss on your cheek, an oddly innocent gesture compared to how she usually is."
        n "Suddenly, Belle pulls the chair you are sitting on, rolling it away from the table."
        n "Expertly, she positions herself on your lap, looking at you from a slightly elevated position."
        n "Your cock stirs in your pants."
        m "What are you doing?"
        b "Can't I show you what a nice time I have been having?"
        b "I haven't had this much fun since I arrived at this camp."
        b "Want me to show you just how grateful I am?"
            b "Want me to show you just how grateful I am?"
                m "But, the doors are open, Belle."
                b "Doesn't that make it even more exciting?"
                n "You can't help arguing that logic as Belle unzips your pants, taking your eager dick out of them."
                b "I've been waiting too long to see it."
                b "That's all I could think about."
                n "Your erection pulsates in Belle's hand as she glides her hands up and down its length, massaging it with great expertise."
                m "Mm, Belle..."
                m "You're too good at this."
                b "I can tell, big boy."
                b "I can tell he's happy to see me, too."
                n "Belle looks at your cock hungrily before she wraps her pretty mouth around it."
                m "Yeah, suck my dick."

                b "Mnnf."
                n "Your hands tangle themselves into Belle's pink locks as you begin to push her head down and onto your shaft."
                n "All for the sake of quieting her pleased moans."
                n "The pace is relentless, but nothing that Belle can't handle."
                m "Shhh."
                n "You remind both Belle and yourself. As good as this is, being caught in this act would be bad."
                n "No, it would be worse than bad."
                n "It would be absolutely catastrophic and something that can't be so easily explained."
                n "Though, knowing how skilled you are with your words, maybe you could think of an explanation."
                n "Maybe you could get away with it."
                b "Mmmm."
                b "You taste so good."

                        n "And you feel that wave crashing around your cock."
                        m "Hnnng."

                b "Thanks for giving me something to think about for the rest of the day."
                b "Hopefully this is not the last time we do something like this."

        s "Yes, no matter how much I have grown close to everyone here, especially you..."

        s "Of course, where else would I go, silly?"
        n "There is a moment of silence between you, giving you some room to think."
        m "Yeah, for sure. I actually wanted to ask you about something else."
        n "Stacy looks at you, expectantly."
        m "About those weird dreams you were having?"
        s "I'm still having them."
        m "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you remember what the dreams were about?"
        m "(I have a sneaking suspicion about what the dreams were about. I really hope I'm wrong.)"
        s "I mean, I can, but it's really abstract."
        m "Hm, try me."
        s "Alright. It was about the night sky, turning red. About smoke rising from the trees."
        s "And the eclipse, there is always that damn eclipse."
        m "(Damn it, why can't I be wrong for once?)"
        m "Stacy, I don't wanna freak you out, but my dreams have been exactly the same."
        s "Exactly the same? You can't know that."
        m "Same description then, I saw the exact same things plus a few extra."
        m "Was there, perhaps, a glowing red waterfall in your dreams?"
        s "..."
        s "Yes, yes there was."
        s "Okay, we may be having the same dreams."
        m "I really had to tell you, those dreams felt so weird. Plus you were in them."
        s "I was in your dreams? I didn't see anyone in mine."
        m "Really? Because I have been chasing you around that nightmarish landscape for a few nights now."
        m "I always see you walking about, but you never seem to notice me. Plus, the last dream I had scared the living shit out of me."
        s "What was it?"
        m "It was you. I see you standing right in front of that waterfall, eyes glowing red. I still have that image burned into my retinas."
        s "Oh, [m!t], that is so weird. Now I'm even more scared!"
        m "No, no, shit, I didn't mean to scare you, I'm sorry."
        m "Come on, there should be a perfectly logical explanation as to why we're both having these dreams."
        s "Do you have any?"
        m "..."
        m "Well, not out of pocket, no, but there must be one."
        s "Maybe we're both just going bananas."
        m "Ha, maybe."
        m "Good thing we're already at a mental health facility."
        s "Pff, I don't think security here can handle both of us going nuts."
        m "You never know. Maybe Eve has a padded room and a couple of straitjackets somewhere in that house."
        s "... Does she?"
        m "Though, I bet she has some kind of restraints."
        m "(Okay, this isn't going anywhere, I think I have another idea.)"

                m "Hey, Stacy, this might seem a little out of the blue..."
                m "But, why haven't you mentioned your actual family yet?"
                s "You mean my biological kin?"
                m "Yes, what's the deal with them?"
                s "I honestly wouldn't know. I haven't been in contact with them ever since I joined my flock."
                m "Not at all? Not even a phone call for holidays?"
                s "No, but I did send them a rather long letter explaining my new purpose in life after I made the rank of Ascendant..."
                s "I invited them to join me, but I am not surprised none of them answered."
                m "(I mean, I wouldn't either, but...)"
                m "Why weren't you surprised?"
                s "Ha! 'Cause they never cared about anything I had to say. It was too loud in the house to hear me, anyways."
                m "And no one was listening?"
                s "Oh, there were plenty of ears listening, but I don't think anyone was really hearing me."
                s "I felt invisible, unless I was in trouble, of course."
                s "Then daddy made sure everyone knew exactly what it was that I did wrong and what my punishment was going to be."
                s "They are old school like that. Tons of kids, church first, husband second and everyone else better fall in line."
                m "That doesn't sound like a happy childhood..."
                s "The funny thing is, it was. I have so many happy memories with my siblings and mom."
                s "But, I always dreamed about going off, starting my own life, choosing my own path."
                m "And your flock gave you that chance?"
                s "Yes, I have never felt such overwhelming sense of belonging and home."
                m "I think I understand. No wonder you give so much of yourself to that group."
                s "Wouldn't you do the same for your family? Especially if it took you your whole life to find them?"
                m "I think I would, yes. Your dedication is admirable, but I think it might be causing your health to suffer."
                s "What do you mean? I'm perfectly healthy."
                m "Stacy, you spent the last couple days aimlessly wandering around camp."
                m "Not to mention a tendency to go into states where you don't even seem to know where you are."
                s "That is pretty standard for someone going through the process of enlightenment."
                s "My mentors warned me I might experience signs of madness, like hallucinations and sleepwalking."
                s "It's the side effects of my mind expanding."
                m "And those are also side effects of someone going through chronic sleep deprivation, or recovering from it."
                m "Did you know that?"
                s "Well, no, I didn't. But I think it's the enlightenment. How could this be from me just being tired?"
                m "Not tired, sleep deprived. There is a big difference. Your brain needs sleep, otherwise we go a little off the rails."
                s "Now that you mention it, here at camp, this is the longest I have slept... Well, ever since I joined 3 years ago."
                m "They didn't let you sleep?"
                s "Of course they did. I just always had better things to do. Sleep was never a high priority."
                m "Hey, Stacy, I wanted to ask you about something..."
                s "Do tell."
                m "Well, I would hope you remember, but we were here together yesterday..."
                s "I was sort of hoping you wouldn't bring that up."
                s "But I guess you must be worried sick about what was going on with me."
                m "To put it mildly, yes."
                m "You acted one way and then it was like you snapped out of a dream..."
                s "That's exactly what happened, good job on that one. You're really observant, you know?"
                m "Sorry, what?!"
                m "Can you run that by me again? I was using a metaphor, what do you mean 'That's exactly what happened'?"
                s "Exactly what I said. I was dreaming, and then I snapped out of it."
                m "You don't mean literally, right?"
                m "Right?!"
                s "Yes, whatever else could I mean?"
                s "It's a little embarrassing, but you brought it up."
                m "Stacy, that's not embarrassing, it's confusing and a little worrying."
                s "No, don't worry, this happens to me sometimes."
                s "I've always been a sleepwalker. More so when I was a kid, but I guess it came back lately."
                m "Really? I mean, it's normal for kids, but it is a little atypical for adults."
                s "It's usually only when I'm really stressed, but I don't know why it's happening now."
                m "Also, it was in the middle of the day, how were you asleep?"
                s "Well, I wanted to take a nap in my cabin, I've been feeling so tired all the time lately."
                s "And I must admit, I was having a rather steamy dream about you."
                    s "But, it caught me a little off guard to realize we were actually doing it."
                    m "Stacy, I am so sorry. If I had any idea you were asleep, I would have never, you know that?"
                    s "No, I know, don't worry. How could you have known?"
                    s "Besides, it ain't every day that a girl's dreams come true, right?"
                    m "Quite literally, huh?"
                    s "But, I didn't realize I was actually coming onto you like that."
                    s "I'm sorry I put you in that position."
                    m "You have nothing to be sorry for, you had no idea what you were doing."
                    m "I mean, you very much knew what you were doing, but you know what I mean."
                    s "Haha, yes, well it's still embarrassing."
                m "I promise, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Have you mentioned any of this to Eve?"
                    m "(Please say no, I can't have Eve busting my balls about inappropriate patient relations twice in one day.)"
                    m "(Please say no, I can't have Eve finding out I've been fooling around with patients.)"
                s "No, should I?"
                m "Maybe not about our little adventures, but she definitely needs to know about your sleepwalking."
                s "But, that's pretty normal for me. My parents used to lock my bedroom door to stop me from roaming around the whole farm."
                m "That's not quite typical either. Do you think something could be stressing you out right now?"
                m "Something that would cause your sleepy brain to go haywire?"
                s "Well, nothing besides being homesick... and the nightmares I guess."
                m "Have you ever had any sleepwalking incidents when you were with your flock?"
                s "Well, no, I slept like a baby when I got a chance to."
                s "There was always so much to do, sleeping was never a number one priority."
        m "I'm not surprised. Sleep deprivation is a very common occurrence in groups like yours."
        s "Hey! No one forced me to lose sleep, it was my choice!"
        m "Of course. I never said it wasn't."
        s "..."
        m "And what about the nightmares? Do you think they're related to your flock?"
        s "No, I don't think they are. Besides, you've been having them, too! How'd you explain that, smart guy?"
        m "Because nightmares occur when we are stressed, that's a fact."
        s "Then I guess this camp is stressing me out more than the flock ever did."
        m "I don't think that's what's going on at all."
        s "And what do you think is happening, huh?"
        m "Well, I think you're having separation anxiety."
        m "I don't think that you mentally left them at all, did you?"
        s "Of course not, I always keep them in my thoughts."
        m "But the longer you are here, the more you feel like you're going to lose them forever. Am I wrong?"
        s "..."
        s "I don't think you're completely wrong about that."
        s "I don't want to lose them."
        m "I understand. Look, this is all a lot; you are mentally dealing with a lot."
        m "I think we should focus on the main thing that can help you right now."
        m "I think you have been burning the candle at both ends, wouldn't you say?"
        n "Stacy looks lost in thought but not in her usual dream-like state."
        n "Something you said seems to have shaken her up."
        s "Hm."
        m "Maybe you should think about resting for a little bit."
        m "I think it would help with your sleep issues if you would allow yourself to relax."
        n "Stacy is nodding her head, you can tell she's listening, but she doesn't look like she will talk to you anymore."
        m "Okay, I think I've given you plenty to think about for one therapy session."
        m "We should wrap it up for today and report back to Dr. Eve."
        s "For sure, you go ahead, I think I need some time."
        m "Of course."
            m "(I have just enough time to help with lunch.)"

em "Aw, I love tortilla wraps!"
nao "Why? They're basically glorified sandwiches. So, I guess it's fitting."
mo "Settle down girls, communal activities strengthen the community's spirit."
nao "I bet Kiara and Violet are lounging in the gazebo by now, setting the table is a much easier task than preparing the food."
em "Come on, Naomi, be positive!"
em "Like Eve said, it's all about community."
m "Speaking of community, where's Stacy?"
em "Huh? I thought she was with you."

            m "Did it?"
            s "Yeah, I have been preaching about making your inner flame shine as bright as the day H.P.L. lit it..."

            m "Are you tired of it? All the cult business?"
            s "Still not a cult. And no, heavens no! Service always takes sacrifice and dedication, it isn't easy."
            m "The girls said I might find you here, but it's unlike you to be alone around the camp."
            m "Usually you're with Belle or the other girls."

            s "Well..."
        s "I was just wondering for how long I can keep going at this pace, you know? It has been... just so much."
        m "Stacy, there is no shame in needing to take a break. You're human, not a robot."

        n "She pauses and thinks, then responds to her own argument."
        s "But, what use is a burnt-out servant?"

            s "Look, I'm not stupid, I know both you, and Eve, are trying to get me to leave the Puncturing Flame..."
            m "No one is trying to make you do that."
            m "We are just worried you might have slipped too far down the rabbit hole and forgot about the real world."
            s "The 'real world'?! "
            n "You better tread lightly, this could escalate quickly."

            s "Isn't that admirable? My Lord would be so pleased if he saw my efforts."
            m "Of course, but as you said, for how long can you keep going before you get sick?"

            m "It would be taking a pause for the cause, you know?"
            s "Yeah, it will probably make me a better servant in the long run."
            s "Thank you, [m!t], for showing me how to be better."
            m "No problem. I'm happy to help."
            m "(I don't think that went in the exact direction I was hoping, but, baby steps, I guess?)"
            s "I'm afraid that if I stop, I'm going to show I'm weak or unfaithful."
            s "But, I'm also afraid what will be left of me if I don't slow down."
            m "I don't think H.P.L. would want you to burn yourself out in service to him, would he?"
            s "Heavens no. That is the exact opposite of what he would want for me."
            s "He wants us all to be the best version of ourselves, that's when his light shines through us the brightest."
            m "So, are you the best version of yourself when you are not resting and only working on recruiting new people?"
            m "So much so, that you even got arrested while doing it?"
            s "Hey, I got arrested because I got a little too heavy handed with the pyre display on a college campus."
            s "But, your point still stands."
            s "So what? I need some good ol' work-life balance?"
            m "You could say so, yes!"
            s "Well, thank you mister doctor, could've never gotten to that one by myself."
            s "When I get really into something, I can really lose myself in it and forget everything else."
            m "Which is not a bad trait, you just need to take care of yourself as well."
            m "Maybe take a few more days off, find a hobby that's not related to the Puncturing Flame?"
            m "Like, have you ever tried video games? They're quite fun for rest and relaxation."
            s "Yes, I have. Cults also have computers, and we use them, believe it or not."
            m "Sorry, what did you just say?"
            s "What? Did you think we still live in the dark ages?"
            m "No, did you just call the Puncturing Flame a cult?"
            s "Maybe?"
            s "It's just because you call it that all the time!"
            m "Hm, for sure. I'll take that as a small victory."
            s "Your interpretation of my words is none of my business."
            m "Of course."
            m "So, what are you thinking? Once you're done with camp?"
            s "Go back to the compound, of course! I can't wait to go home."
            m "Then you better rest up now, while you still can."
            m "Since you plan to go back to being a workhorse there."
            s "There is so much joy in the work that we do, you should definitely pay us a visit one day."
            s "I can show you all the good that we do..."
            m "Mark that as a maybe. I find much more joy in resting, personally."
            s "Suit yourself. I don't have much choice but to rest at the moment, so I'll make the most of it, I guess."
            m "You should, yeah."
            m "You wanna join the rest of the girls for lunch with me?"
            s "Yes, sir! I'm starving."
        m "We better leave her alone, our session was a little intense."
        m "Besides, I came to help you girls out, you look like you need it!"
v "Sorry, which one is a vegetable-filled tortilla?"
m "Oh, it's the one on your right, Violet."
nao "Are you a vegan or a vegetarian, Violet?"
v "A vegetarian. My father wouldn't allow me to become a vegan."
v "Says itâ€™s not good for your body. Iâ€™d really like to go vegan, though."
nao "Why exactly?"
v "I saw a documentary once, about chicken farms."
v "I think I cried three times. I just couldnâ€™t participate in an industry that is so unethical."
m "I think that's really nice of you, Violet. Shows how kind you are."
n "Violet smiles at you. Good job, [m!t]."
nao "Huh. I couldn't go without meat for a single day."
n "An uncomfortable silence falls upon the girls. Suddenly, Naomi speaks up."
nao "Which just gives me more reason to think you're really brave, Violet."
n "You smile to yourself. Naomi's really an alright girl underneath all that arrogance and wealth."
    n "You look over to Stacy. She seems better, less gloomy."
    m "(Hopefully I helped her get some closure with that talk.)"
    n "She sees you looking at her and smiles. You see remnants of doubt in her eyes."
    n "You look over at Belle. She gives you a wink. You really hope Eve didn't see that."
mo "So, Naomi, how is your short story collection coming along?"
v "Yeah, and when are we going to get to read it?"
nao "It's actually going quite well."
nao "I think I'm really getting to know more about myself through these sessions and I'm able to use this in my writings."
m "That's really cool. Would you be willing to share one of your stories?"
mo "I think we'd all like to hear that."
nao "Well, I have realized how much of my life is based around appearances."
nao "I started thinking about what would be left of me if I removed what other people thought of me."
v "That's really interesting. What did you find out?"
n "There's a certain look of sadness on Naomi's face. You can almost guess what she's about to say."
nao "I discovered there wouldn't be anything left. I would be empty."
n "A moment of silence passes. It seems like everyone is giving her space to say what she needs to."
nao "So, I wrote a story about a girl that wakes up in a parallel universe and finds herself all alone in the world."
nao "She realizes she doesn't really know who she is anymore."
nao "So, as she's trying to get back home, she's also trying to find herself."
mo "That's beautiful, Naomi. I'm sure it will be an amazing story."
nao "Thank you, Eve. I sure hope so."
s "I feel like that too, actually."
n "Everyone turns their heads and looks at Stacy. It seems no one predicted her saying something."
mo "What do you mean, Stacy?"
s "I guess I..."
n "As she's struggling to find words, you see Belle reaching out and squeezing her hand. Stacy gives her a thankful smile."
s "I guess I realized I don't know who I am, not fully."
s "I was so focused on worshiping my religion, I forgot to focus on myself. I'd..."
s "I'd actually really like to go back to school and finish my studies."
b "That's great, Stacy. I'm really happy for you."
v "I guess we're all just looking for a place to belong."
v "A few years back, I felt just like you two."
v "I was chasing a sports career, trying to be the best, when I suddenly stopped and thought to myself:"
v "Who am I without my achievements?"
v "When I had to retreat from sports, I was angry and mournful, but then... I was happy."
v "Because, for once in my life, I was left with nothing. It's a surprisingly hopeful place to be in."
v "You can only go up."
v "And, I realized, if one day something happens and I die in my sleep, I won't be sad."
v "Because I put down roots. I loved and fought, and won and lost."
v "And on my deathbed, I won't remember the accomplishments I made, I'll remember the people I loved."
mo "That's beautiful, Violet. I think it's something we should all remember. How to lean on the ones we love and persevere?"
m "(Wow, I didn't think my lunch would go like this...)"
m "(I'm feeling oddly sentimental...)"
mo "As it is, I'm sad Emily wasn't here to hear this. She sure could use a lesson in maturity."
n "As you look around, you realize it's true. Emily is nowhere to be found."
m "Wait, where is Emily?"
mo "There's always something with that girl..."
mo "She's probably still at the house. You should go and bring her here."
mo "She's gonna miss out on lunch."
m "She was looking forward to this lunch so much, going to bring her asap."
m "Girls, please leave something for Em. We'll be right back."
m "(This is weird. I wonder what Emily is doing?)"
n "You look back on the day so far. It was eventful, wasn't it?"
    m "(I'm so glad I finally spent some time with Emily)."
    m "(I really wish we had spent more time together in the past. Luckily, it's not too late.)"
    m "(And even after what she pulled this morning, she managed not to make the rest of the day awkward.)"

    m "(I have to admit I kinda liked how our day together went.)"
    m "(And Em... damn, I like her too.)"
    m "(Not only is she freaking gorgeous, but she's so fun to be around.)"
    m "(Wonder what Emily was doing the whole day?)"
    m "(I mean, she did actually get the girls in the morning... and they weren't late!)"
    m "(That's oddly responsible for Em.)"
    m "(It's definitely clear she grew up. In more ways than one.)"
    m "(I have to admit, she is freaking gorgeous.)"
    m "(Wouldn't mind having some alone time with her.)"
m "(Where could she be?)"
m "Damn."
m "(What if she's not in the house at all?)"
m "(What if she's somewhere around the campground?)"
m "Nah. (We would have seen her from the gazebo.)"
n "As you enter, you look towards the kitchen first, almost instinctively."
m "(She's not there.)"
n "Then a soft sound worms its way into your ear, changing you forever."
m "Em?"
m "Emily?"
n "She can barely be seen or heard. But still, you hear her."
n "She's moaning softly, her breathing intermittent and shallow."
m "(What is she...)"
n "She's lying there, more beautiful than ever."
n "Biting her lower lip, her eyes closed..."
n "She's touching herself, gently penetrating herself with her fingers."
em "Uhhhh..."
m "(Fuck.)"
n "You stand in awe, blood flowing to your member as you're enraptured by the sight of her."
em "Ahhhhh, mmmmm."
m "(Fuck.)"
em "[m!ct]..."
m "Fuck."
n "There's no question about it. She heard you."
m "(Shit, I should have used my inner voice.)"
n "Emily slowly turns, her lithe body easing on the couch."
n "Her pants are on the floor and she's naked below the waist. She looks at you. Her emerald eyes smiling."
em "Hey, [m!t]."
em "I just finished thinking about you."
