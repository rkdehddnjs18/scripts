Narr:	*Thunderclap*
Narr:	Getting out of bed...
Narr:	You slowly make your way towards the window.
Me: 	(It's really coming down hard.)
Me: 	(Hope she'll make it.)
Me: 	(Oh, that must be her.)
Narr:	The door cracks open ever so slightly... 
Narr:	Letting in a beam of bright light from the hallway.
Jane:	Anyone here?
Me: 	Come on in, silly.
Narr:	Jane steps into your room.
Narr:	As she does, you can't help but admire...
Narr:	Her long, slender legs...
Narr:	Tight waist...
Narr:	And a smile no guy could resist.
Jane:	It's so dark in here, I can barely see you.
Narr:	Saying this, she closes the door.
Narr:	While you use the chance to move a few steps closer...
Me: 	Want me to turn the lights on?
Jane:	No need.
Narr:	Almost immediately, she leaps into your arms and kisses you.
Narr:	Looking straight into your eyes...
Jane:	I missed you.
Me: 	*Chuckle* Missed you too, babe.
Me: 	Wanna dry off? Here, take my shirt.
Jane:	I just walked in a second ago, and you already want me to take my clothes off?
Me: 	Well, you do look cold.
Jane:	Mind warming me up then?
Narr:	You share another long kiss.
Narr:	After a second or two, she pushes you back a little...
Me: 	Better?
Jane:	Not quite.
Jane:	You'll have to do a little bit better.
Narr:	Before you can respond, she pulls off her shirt.
Me: 	No bra?
Jane:	I was in a hurry to get here.
Jane:	Wait, are you complaining?
Me: 	Does that sound like a complaint?
Jane:	A bit.
Narr:	Slowly, Jane moves towards the center of the room...
Jane:	I missed being here, in your dorm room.
Me: 	Well, you were gone for two months.
Jane:	I know...
Jane:	Sorry for leaving like that...
Me: 	Don't worry about it. I mean, it really was a great opportunity. 
Narr:	Getting closer...
Me: 	Tell me all about it?
Jane:	You seriously wanna talk about mental patients now? 
Jane:	When I'm standing in the middle of your room, half naked?
Me: 	Point taken.
Jane:	Good.
Narr:	All of a sudden...
Narr:	Jane pushes you...
Narr:	Causing you to stumble and fall onto your bed.
Narr:	Slowly...
Narr:	Jane prowls towards you...
Narr:	And pulls down your pants.
Jane:	Looks like you really did miss me.
Narr:	With a smile, she gets down on her knees.
Narr:	Wrapping her soft hand around your cock...
Narr:	She slowly starts stroking.
Jane:	God, I've missed this...
Me: 	Me too...
Narr:	Unable to stop herself, she starts playfully licking your tip.
Jane:	Mmmm...
Narr:	Getting more than excited, soon enough...
Narr:	She slides her lips onto your cock...
Me: 	*Groan*
Jane:	*Giggle* *Slurp*
Narr:	Obviously enjoying your reactions, she continues...
Narr:	Swallowing more of your length.
Jane:	*Gglg*
Me: 	This feels more than perfect, babe...
Jane:	*Gglg* *Slurp* Mhhmmm...
Me: 	Come here.
Narr:	A bit surprised, Jane pulls your cock out of her mouth.
Jane:	What? It's not good?
Me: 	No, it's great! I just...
Me: 	To be honest, I can't wait to fuck you.
Narr:	Saying nothing at first, she stands up...
Jane:	Oh? You can't?
Me: 	*Nod*
Narr:	Sensually, she unbuttons her pants...
Narr:	And slides them off.
Me: 	You are beautiful.
Jane:	Don't say that... It'll go to my head.
Narr:	Continuing where she left off, Jane starts taking off her panties.
Me: 	It definitely should go to your head. You're the most perfect girl I know.
Narr:	Finally, Jane is standing in front of you... completely naked.
Jane:	Oh? You really think so?
Me: 	I know so.
Narr:	Playfully, she jumps onto you.
Narr:	Grabbing your cock and placing it on her ass.
Narr:	She starts grinding against your shaft...
Narr:	Her every move sending jolts down your entire body.
Narr:	As she raises her hips, your cock slides underneath her...
Narr:	Stopping perfectly, right at the entrance of her pussy.
Jane:	I want you to fuck me really hard.
Narr:	And in one swift motion...
Narr:	She impales herself onto your rock-hard cock.
Me: 	Oh, fuck!
Narr:	Her completely soaked pussy easily sliding around your rod...
Narr:	Slowly moving her hips, Jane starts riding you.
Jane:	*Moan* That's it...
Jane:	Mmmm...
Jane:	*Moan* So good.
Me: 	(She did say "fuck me real hard"...)
Narr:	And so you do.
Jane:	*Moan* Mmm-ahh!
Jane:	Y-Yes...
tut: You'll recognize them by the arrows you can see on-screen now.
tut: Once this tutorial ends, you can use them to change your point of view.
tut: Finally, clicking anywhere other than the arrows will continue the story.
tut: Did you notice the camera button in the lower left corner?
tut: You can take a picture and it will be saved in your private collection in the Gallery.
Jane:	I'll never get enough of your size! *Moan*
Jane:	A-Ahh... Harder!
Jane:	Yes... Mmmm... Yes, that's it! *Moan*
Me: 	Your pussy is perfect, too!
Jane:	*Moan* Ahhh... Fuck, YES! Mmm...
Jane:	So... Fucking... GOOD!
Jane:	Fuck my little pussy! Hard-Ahh!
Jane:	Yes! Harder! I want you to fuck me harder!
Narr:	More than happy to fulfill her desire... You grab her ass with both hands...
Narr:	And start slamming your whole length into her...
Jane:	OHH, FUCK ME! That's it! *Moan*
Jane:	Fuck-Fuck-Fuck! AAAHH!
Jane:	Yes! AHH! Mmmm... AHH!
Jane:	So fucking... Ahhh! DON'T STOP!
Jane:	Yes! KEEP GO-AHH! JUST LIKE THAT!
Jane:	Shit! So good! Ahh!
Jane:	I'm cumming! I'm cumming!
Jane:	DON'T STOP! DON'T STOP! DON'T ST-AAAAAHHH!
Jane:	*Screams* FUUUCK!!!
Narr:	Her whole body tenses up, quivering as if you're shaking her...
Jane:	FUCKING... AHHHHHHHH!
Narr:	Following that long, pleasure-filled scream, Jane collapses onto your chest.
Jane:	*Pant* Pheww… I needed this sooo badly...
Me: 	*Chuckle* I believe you. That was fast.
Jane:	Shush, you! There are no words to describe how horny I was.
Jane:	*Long breath* Want me to get on my back?
Me: 	Already? You don't need a break?
Narr:	Before answering, she straightens up, with you still inside her.
tut: Click on this button when it appears, to change the angle of the image.
Jane:	Oh, we are not done here, mister. Not by a long shot...
Narr:	She sprawls onto the bed.
Narr:	And, as she does...
Narr:	She slowly spreads her legs.
Jane:	You coming?
Narr:	Without wasting a second, you jump into position.
Me: 	You don't have to ask me twice.
Jane:	Uhhh... *Moan*
Jane:	Ahhh... Mmmm...
Jane:	*Moan* Harder...
Me: 	Fuck, it feels so amazing!
Jane:	Ahh! Yes, it fucking does!
Jane:	Ahhh! *Moan* More!
Me: 	I love watching your perfect tits bounce.
Jane:	And I-Aaah! I love your cock! Ooh... *Moan*
Me: 	(I don't know how I managed to keep going without this for two months.)
Me: 	(I mean, look at her! Fuck! She's SO fucking hot!)
Jane:	YES! Fuck! *Moan* Mmmm...
Me: 	(I can't take it anymore... I gotta feel her boobs.)
Jane:	Ahh! Yes! *Moan* Mmmm...
Jane:	Fuck! Fuck me! Yes! Gaaahh!
Me: 	(Her tits are so soft!)
Jane:	Harder! *Moan* I want you to fuck me harder!
Jane:	Fuck me stupid! Pound me like a slut! Aaahh!
Me: 	(I love when she talks dirty like this.)
Jane:	Ahhh! Yes! Fuck! Mmm-AAH!
Narr:	Not stopping, even for a moment...
Narr:	Almost aggressively, you grab both her legs and lift them up
Jane:	Woah!
Me: 	*Chuckle* You asked for it!
Jane:	Ohhh! Fuck! Yes! AHH!
Jane:	Shit! Fuck, YES!
Jane:	Fuck me! YES! MORE!
Jane:	*Moan* I'm gonna cum again! Shit!
Jane:	Mmmm-Ahh! Yes!
Narr:	Her legs start trembling in your hands...
Narr:	An orgasm completely washing over her.
Jane:	OH MY GOD!!!
Jane:	*Pant* Wow... Did you practice while I was away? *Giggle*
Me: 	Hahahah! Good one.
Me: 	You know I'd never cheat on you.
Jane:	I know, silly. I'm just joking.
Me: 	On a more important note...
Me: 	How about you turn around?
Jane:	You mean...
Jane:	Like this?
Me: 	Exactly like that!
Narr:	You immediately position your cock less than an inch away from her pussy.
Narr:	And gently push it inside.
Jane:	*Moan*
Jane:	I love this position! Mmmm...
Jane:	It hits-Ahh! It hits just right!
Jane:	*Moan* Yes!
Narr:	Soon, you pick up the pace.
Jane:	Ahhh! Fuck, yes! Mmmm...
Jane:	Fuck me! Fuck me!
Jane:	I want you to cum for me, baby.
Jane:	A-Ahhh! Fuck! It's hitting so deep!
Narr:	Hearing this, you grab Jane's hands...
Jane:	Huh?!
Me: 	And now it'll go in even deeper...
Jane:	OH, FUCK!
Jane:	Shit! YES! AAAHH!
Jane:	AHHH! FUCK!!! AAAH!!!
Jane:	I'M GONNA-FUCK! AHHH!!! DON'T STOP!!!
Jane:	*Pant* I'M GONNA CUM AGAIN!
Me: 	I'm close too!
Jane:	MMHMM! CUM FOR ME! *moan*
Jane:	*Moan* A-AAAH! AAAAAHHH!!!
Narr:	As you let go of Jane’s arms, she falls onto the bed.
Narr:	You cum all over her ass, and back.
Narr:	She is squirming through her third orgasm, now.
Narr:	Exhausted, you collapse onto the bed next to her.
Jane:	*Pant* *Pant* Phew...
Me: 	*Pant* *Cough* "Phew", indeed.
Narr:	Turning your head towards her...
Narr:	There was just enough light to see her beautiful face.
Jane:	I like you a lot, Dennis.
Me: 	Thanks… You’re also kinda the best.
Narr:	A satisfied smile forms on her face.
Narr:	Suddenly changing the subject...
Jane:	The weather outside is crazy.
Me: 	To put it mildly, yeah.
Narr:	Not really feeling like talking about weather... You change the subject.
Me: 	So? I'm listening now. How was it?
Jane:	*Chuckle* The sex or the trip?
Jane:	*Chuckle* The sex or the trip?
    Me: 	*Chuckle* The sex, of course. *chuckle*
    Jane:	Sex was, ummm... Okay-ish.
    Me: 	"Okay-ish"?
    Jane:	Yeah, it was okay.
    Me: 	Really? Just "okay"?
    Jane:	Hahaha, okay, okay... It was great.
    Me: 	*Chuckle* That's what I thought.
    Me: 	And how about the...
    Me: 	Actually, I meant how was it being there without your phone.
    Jane:	It sucked because I couldn't call you.
    Me: 	That's sweet.
    Jane:	Because I'm sweet. See? I told you it'd go to my head.
    Me: 	You really are sweet, babe.
    Jane:	Awww... Thanks!
    Me: 	And how about the...
Me: 	Trip?
Jane:	To be honest, exhausting. I've seen so much...
Me: 	So much?
Jane:	So much "crazy" that I'm not even sure I want to finish this study.
Me: 	Are you supposed to call them crazy?
Jane:	Okay, "mentally disturbed". Although, this was on a whole new level.
Me: 	Weren't you prepared for that? It is an institution for the criminally insane, after all.
Jane:	"Prepared", huh?
Jane:	Nothing can prepare you for that. Sleeping in the same building as them, taking away our phones...
Jane:	Sometimes, I felt like I was in a horror movie. It was all just... too surreal.
Me: 	For example?
Jane:	I'd rather not go there right now. Can we talk about something else?
Me: 	Sure.
Jane:	How was college? We have so much catching up to do.
Me: 	Oh, you know, same old...
Me: 	Professor Cawley is still bald and professor Naehring is still acting like a Nazi.
Jane:	*Giggle* So, nothing's changed?
Me: 	Guess not.
Jane:	And? Got anything planned for the summer? 
Jane:	It's the last day of the semester and all.
Me: 	I think I'll just stay here. Maybe get a summer job and chill.
Jane:	You're not going back home?
Me: 	Home? Hah! Hell no.
Me: 	You?
Jane:	I'm not sure. I should go visit my parents... at least for a couple of days.
Jane:	But I don't wanna leave you again.
Me: 	Don't worry, I get it.
Jane:	You might be a little too understanding, you know that?
Me: 	Umm... Uh... I guess?
Jane:	How about...
Jane:	We hang out on campus for a couple weeks then... let's go on a trip! How about... camping?
Me: 	You want to be alone with me in a secluded forest?
Jane:	What, you're gonna leave me tied up in a tree?
Me: 	Well... maybe not up in a tree... maybe to a tree.
Jane:	Oooh... Sounds fun.
Me: 	Don't worry. I'll take good care of you.
Jane:	And what are you going--
Narr:	She's interrupted by your phone's loud ringtone.
Me: 	Just a second.
Me: 	Hmm. Why is she--
Jane:	Well? Not gonna answer? (There he goes again... being so vague and secretive.)
Narr:	You mute the phone and place it on the nightstand.
Me: 	It's not important.
Jane:	Why didn't you answer?
Me: 	I just don't feel... 
Narr:	You are interrupted by the ringing, again.
Narr:	So, again, you pick it up...
Jane:	Just answer it, [m].
Me: 	*Sigh*
Jane:	Maybe it's important.
Me: 	I doubt it.
Narr:	You put the phone back.
Me: 	So for the summer, what do you wanna do firs--
Narr:	Interrupted again.
Me: 	Ughh!
Narr:	Angrily, you pick up the phone and answer...
Me: 	WHAT?!
Eve:	I'm so sorry to bother you this late, Dennis.
Me: 	Sorry for yelling. I'm in the middle of something...
Eve:	I wouldn't be calling if it weren't so important.
Me: 	What's going on?
Eve:	Look... I really need your help back at camp this summer.
Me: 	This is really last minute, Eve.
Me: 	I'm sorry, but I've already made plans.
Eve:	There's been a development, and you need to come as soon as possible.
Eve:	I have no one else to call.
Me: 	What "development"? Why do you even need ME?!
Eve:	*I'll explain everything when you get here.*
Me: 	Can't I even say no?
Eve:	*...*
Me: 	I really can't come. You'll have to find someone else.
Eve:	*I need you here, Dennis. Tomorrow.*
Me: 	Tomorrow?! What the--
Eve:	*[m!ct], I'm depending on you.*
Jane:	(Seriously?! Tomorrow?!)
Me: 	Ugh!
Eve:	*I can't do this without you, Dennis. I need someone here that I can depend on.*
Narr:	Trying not to blow a fuse, you stay silent.
Eve:	*Take a bus tomorrow. There's one leaving at 5 AM.*
Me: 	And you only NOW decided to tell me?! Literally, six hours in advance?!
Eve:	*My apprentice cancelled last minute.*
Eve:	*I'll make it up to you, I promise.*
Me: 	Fine, I'll come.
Me: 	But I'm really not happy about this, Eve.
Eve:	*You're a lifesaver, Dennis.*
Eve:	*I knew I could count on you.*
Jane:	What happened?
Me: 	I... Uhh....
Jane:	Looks like you're going back to the camp, after all.
Me: 	Yeah... Looks like I am...
Jane:	It's okay...
Me: 	No! It's not... We made plans.
Me: 	I wanted to spend my summer with you.
Jane:	Can't I come with you?
Me: 	Trust me, you do not want that.
Jane:	Why not?
Me: 	You just don't.
Jane:	Why? Because she runs a camp for delinquent boys?
Me: 	Ye-Wait... How do you know about that?
Jane:	Gugle? Heard of it?
Me: 	So you Gugled me?
Jane:	Hey! There are lots of creeps out there. A girl's gotta be careful nowadays.
Me: 	So when you met me, you thought I was a creep?
Jane:	A bit.
Me: 	Great...
Narr:	Almost jumping off the bed, she hugs you.
Jane:	Even if you are a creep... You're a cute creep.
Me: 	Ha-ha-ha...
Jane:	I knew I'd make you laugh, sooner or later.
Me: 	It was a sarcastic laugh.
Jane:	Still a laugh. *Giggle*
Jane:	I could come with you... The camp must have a shadowy forest I could camp out in, nearby.
Me: 	I just don't think it's a good idea.
Jane:	But why? I spent two months with the most dangerous, criminally-insane people in this country...
Jane:	You think I can't handle a few eighteen-year-old kleptos and non-stop masturbators?
Me: 	It's not about that.
Jane:	Well, spit it out then... What is it?!
Me: 	I don't really wanna talk about it right now.
Jane:	Hmm… Okay.
Me: 	The whole situation at camp is, well... messy.
Jane:	I can handle "messy".
Me: 	I know you can, babe. I just don't want you to.
Me: 	Tell you what, let me see how things are when I get there... and then maybe you can come visit.
Me: 	In the meantime, you can go visit your parents.
Me: 	You haven't seen them in months... You probably miss them a lot.
Jane:	That's true... Though, I think they miss me more.
Me: 	I shouldn't be there more than a week.
Jane:	A week? Without you, hot stuff?
Me: 	We managed two months without seeing or hearing each other...
Me: 	What's a week, right? Plus, we can actually call each other and talk this time!
Jane:	True! What's a week?! Nothing!
Me: 	Okay, so we have a deal?
Jane:	Deal!
Me: 	Ugh... I should get packing...
Jane:	Want me to help?
Me: 	You're the best, babe.
Jane:	No, no. I'm the best because... I'll do it naked! *Giggle*
Me: 	You truly are wonderful... And, that ass of your helps, too.
Jane:	Less talking, more packing! You need to get some sleep too.
Jane:	Oh, and... At least for tonight, I'm sleeping with you.
Me: 	Sounds perfect.
Narr:	With Jane's help, you get packed...
Narr:	And go to bed, soon after.
Narr:	The next morning...
Narr:	5 AM.
Me: 	*Whispers* Jane...
Narr:	You try nudging her a little...
Jane:	Zzzzzz...
Me: 	(She must be exhausted from the trip.)
Me: 	(Should I wake her up?)
    Me: 	Hey, Jane. Wake up.
    Jane:	Hmmph?
    Me: 	I have to go.
    Jane:	Wha... Already?
    Me: 	Yes. (She looks exhausted.)
    Narr:	You plant a gentle kiss on her cheek...
    Me: 	You can go back to sleep. Call me when you wake up.
    Jane:	Mhmmm...
Narr:	Standing up...
Narr:	You grab your bags...
Narr:	And make your way towards the door.
Narr:	Before leaving, you sneak one last look at Jane.
Narr:	And, finally, you leave.
Me: 	*Pant* *Pant* *Pant*
Me: 	Just in time.
Me: 	(Huh? Where's the bus?)
Narr:	Realizing the bus isn't near, you sit down.
Me: 	(Good thing I almost busted a lung running here.)
Me: 	*Sigh* (I still don't get it...)
Me: 	(Why did Eve's apprentice bail on her last minute?)
Me: 	(I bet they didn't want to waste their entire summer there, again…)
Narr:	However, your thoughts are interrupted by the bus pulling into the stop.
Me: 	(Well, here we go...)
Narr:	You board the empty bus...
Narr:	And sit down.
Me: 	(Of course it's empty... No one ever takes this line...)
Narr:	The bus gets going and, slowly, buildings pass you by...
Me: 	(Leaving the city...)
Me: 	*Sigh*
Narr:	About an hour later...
Me: 	(Back to nature...)
Me: 	(Usually I like nature...)
Me: 	(But going back home...)
Me: 	(Not a fan...)
Narr:	Three hours later, you finally arrive.
Narr:	Leaving the bus, you notice...
Me: 	(Yeah... I guess it was too much to ask for someone to pick me up.)
Me: 	(Better be on my way, then...)
Narr:	Around thirty minutes of walking later...
Narr:	You arrive at the entrance of the camp.
Narr:	With a sigh, you look up.
Me: 	(Red Falls...)
