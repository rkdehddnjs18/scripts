n "*Thunderclap*"
n "Getting out of bed..."
n "You slowly make your way towards the window."
m "(It's really coming down hard.)"
m "(Hope she'll make it.)"
m "(Oh, that must be her.)"
n "The door cracks open ever so slightly... "
n "Letting in a beam of bright light from the hallway."
j "Anyone here?"
m "Come on in, silly."
n "Jane steps into your room."
n "As she does, you can't help but admire..."
n "Her long, slender legs..."
n "Tight waist..."
n "And a smile no guy could resist."
j "It's so dark in here, I can barely see you."
n "Saying this, she closes the door."
n "While you use the chance to move a few steps closer..."
m "Want me to turn the lights on?"
j "No need."
n "Almost immediately, she leaps into your arms and kisses you."
n "Looking straight into your eyes..."
j "I missed you."
m "*Chuckle* Missed you too, babe."
m "Wanna dry off? Here, take my shirt."
j "I just walked in a second ago, and you already want me to take my clothes off?"
m "Well, you {i}do{/i} look cold."
j "Mind warming me up then?"
n "You share another long kiss."
n "After a second or two, she pushes you back a little..."
m "Better?"
j "Not quite."
j "You'll have to do a {i}little bit{/i} better."
n "Before you can respond, she pulls off her shirt."
m "No bra?"
j "I was in a hurry to get here."
j "Wait, are you complaining?"
m "Does that sound like a complaint?"
j "{i}A bit{/i}."
n "Slowly, Jane moves towards the center of the room..."
j "I missed being here, in your dorm room."
m "Well, you were gone for two months."
j "I know..."
j "Sorry for leaving like that..."
m "Don't worry about it. I mean, it really was a great opportunity. "
n "Getting closer..."
m "Tell me all about it?"
j "You seriously wanna talk about mental patients now? "
j "When I'm standing in the middle of your room, half naked?"
m "Point taken."
j "Good."
n "All of a sudden..."
n "Jane pushes you..."
n "Causing you to stumble and fall onto your bed."
n "Slowly..."
n "Jane prowls towards you..."
n "And pulls down your pants."
j "Looks like you really did miss me."
n "With a smile, she gets down on her knees."
n "Wrapping her soft hand around your cock..."
n "She slowly starts stroking."
j "God, I've missed this..."
m "Me too..."
n "Unable to stop herself, she starts playfully licking your tip."
j "Mmmm..."
n "Getting more than excited, soon enough..."
n "She slides her lips onto your cock..."
m "*Groan*"
j "*Giggle* *Slurp*"
n "Obviously enjoying your reactions, she continues..."
n "Swallowing more of your length."
j "*Gglg*"
m "This feels more than perfect, babe..."
j "*Gglg* *Slurp* Mhhmmm..."
m "Come here."
n "A bit surprised, Jane pulls your cock out of her mouth."
j "What? It's not good?"
m "No, it's great! I just..."
m "To be honest, I can't wait to fuck you."
n "Saying nothing at first, she stands up..."
j "Oh? You can't?"
m "*Nod*"
n "Sensually, she unbuttons her pants..."
n "And slides them off."
m "You are beautiful."
j "Don't say that... It'll go to my head."
n "Continuing where she left off, Jane starts taking off her panties."
m "It definitely should go to your head. You're the most perfect girl I know."
n "Finally, Jane is standing in front of you... completely naked."
j "Oh? You really think so?"
m "I {i}know{/i} so."
n "Playfully, she jumps onto you."
n "Grabbing your cock and placing it on her ass."
n "She starts grinding against your shaft..."
n "Her every move sending jolts down your entire body."
n "As she raises her hips, your cock slides underneath her..."
n "Stopping perfectly, right at the entrance of her pussy."
j "I want you to fuck me really hard."
n "And in one swift motion..."
n "She impales herself onto your rock-hard cock."
m "Oh, fuck!"
n "Her completely soaked pussy easily sliding around your rod..."
n "Slowly moving her hips, Jane starts riding you."
j "*Moan* That's it..."
j "Mmmm..."
j "*Moan* So good."
m "(She did say {i}\"fuck me real hard\"{/i}...)"
n "And so you do."
j "*Moan* Mmm-ahh!"
j "Y-Yes..."
tut "You'll recognize them by the arrows you can see on-screen now."
tut "Once this tutorial ends, you can use them to change your point of view."
tut "Finally, clicking anywhere other than the arrows will continue the story."
tut "Did you notice the camera button in the lower left corner?"
tut "You can take a picture and it will be saved in your private collection in the Gallery."
j "I'll never get enough of your size! *Moan*"
j "A-Ahh... Harder!"
j "Yes... Mmmm... Yes, that's it! *Moan*"
m "Your pussy is perfect, too!"
j "*Moan* Ahhh... Fuck, YES! Mmm..."
j "So... Fucking... GOOD!"
j "Fuck my little pussy! Hard-Ahh!"
j "Yes! Harder! I want you to fuck me harder!"
n "More than happy to fulfill her desire... You grab her ass with both hands..."
n "And start slamming your whole length into her..."
j "OHH, FUCK ME! That's it! *Moan*"
j "Fuck-Fuck-Fuck! AAAHH!"
j "Yes! AHH! Mmmm... AHH!"
j "So fucking... Ahhh! DON'T STOP!"
j "Yes! KEEP GO-AHH! JUST LIKE THAT!"
j "Shit! So good! Ahh!"
j "I'm cumming! I'm cumming!"
j "DON'T STOP! DON'T STOP! DON'T ST-AAAAAHHH!"
j "*Screams* FUUUCK!!!"
n "Her whole body tenses up, quivering as if you're shaking her..."
j "FUCKING... AHHHHHHHH!"
n "Following that long, pleasure-filled scream, Jane collapses onto your chest."
j "*Pant* Pheww… I needed this sooo badly..."
m "*Chuckle* I believe you. That was fast."
j "Shush, you! There are no words to describe how horny I was."
j "*Long breath* Want me to get on my back?"
m "Already? You don't need a break?"
n "Before answering, she straightens up, with you still inside her."
tut "Click on this button when it appears, to change the angle of the image."
j "Oh, we are not done here, mister. Not by a long shot..."
n "She sprawls onto the bed."
n "And, as she does..."
n "She slowly spreads her legs."
j "You coming?"
n "Without wasting a second, you jump into position."
m "You don't have to ask me twice."
j "Uhhh... *Moan*"
j "Ahhh... Mmmm..."
j "*Moan* Harder..."
m "Fuck, it feels so amazing!"
j "Ahh! Yes, it fucking does!"
j "Ahhh! *Moan* More!"
m "I love watching your perfect tits bounce."
j "And I-Aaah! I love your cock! Ooh... *Moan*"
m "(I don't know how I managed to keep going without this for two months.)"
m "(I mean, look at her! Fuck! She's SO fucking hot!)"
j "YES! Fuck! *Moan* Mmmm..."
m "(I can't take it anymore... I gotta feel her boobs.)"
j "Ahh! Yes! *Moan* Mmmm..."
j "Fuck! Fuck me! Yes! Gaaahh!"
m "(Her tits are so soft!)"
j "Harder! *Moan* I want you to fuck me harder!"
j "Fuck me stupid! Pound me like a slut! Aaahh!"
m "(I love when she talks dirty like this.)"
j "Ahhh! Yes! Fuck! Mmm-AAH!"
n "Not stopping, even for a moment..."
n "Almost aggressively, you grab both her legs and lift them up"
j "Woah!"
m "*Chuckle* You asked for it!"
j "Ohhh! Fuck! Yes! AHH!"
j "Shit! Fuck, YES!"
j "Fuck me! YES! MORE!"
j "*Moan* I'm gonna cum again! Shit!"
j "Mmmm-Ahh! Yes!"
n "Her legs start trembling in your hands..."
n "An orgasm completely washing over her."
j "OH MY GOD!!!"
j "*Pant* Wow... Did you practice while I was away? *Giggle*"
m "Hahahah! Good one."
m "You know I'd never cheat on you."
j "I know, silly. I'm just joking."
m "On a more important note..."
m "How about you turn around?"
j "You mean..."
j "{i}Like this?{/i}"
m "Exactly like that!"
n "You immediately position your cock less than an inch away from her pussy."
n "And gently push it inside."
j "*Moan*"
j "I love this position! Mmmm..."
j "It hits-Ahh! It hits just right!"
j "*Moan* Yes!"
n "Soon, you pick up the pace."
j "Ahhh! Fuck, yes! Mmmm..."
j "Fuck me! Fuck me!"
j "I want you to cum for me, baby."
j "A-Ahhh! Fuck! It's hitting so deep!"
n "Hearing this, you grab Jane's hands..."
j "Huh?!"
m "And now it'll go in even deeper..."
j "OH, FUCK!"
j "Shit! YES! AAAHH!"
j "AHHH! FUCK!!! AAAH!!!"
j "I'M GONNA-FUCK! AHHH!!! DON'T STOP!!!"
j "*Pant* I'M GONNA CUM AGAIN!"
m "I'm close too!"
j "MMHMM! CUM FOR ME! *moan*"
j "*Moan* A-AAAH! AAAAAHHH!!!"
n "As you let go of Jane’s arms, she falls onto the bed."
n "You cum all over her ass, and back."
n "She is squirming through her third orgasm, now."
n "Exhausted, you collapse onto the bed next to her."
j "*Pant* *Pant* Phew..."
m "*Pant* *Cough* {i}\"Phew\"{/i}, indeed."
n "Turning your head towards her..."
n "There was just enough light to see her beautiful face."
j "I like you a lot, [m!t]."
m "Thanks… You’re also kinda the best."
n "A satisfied smile forms on her face."
n "Suddenly changing the subject..."
j "The weather outside is crazy."
m "To put it mildly, yeah."
n "Not really feeling like talking about weather... You change the subject."
m "So? I'm listening now. How was it?"
j "*Chuckle* The sex or the trip?"
j "*Chuckle* The sex or the trip?"
    m "*Chuckle* The sex, of course. *chuckle*"
    j "Sex was, ummm... Okay-ish."
    m "{i}\"Okay-ish\"{/i}?"
    j "Yeah, it was okay."
    m "Really? Just {i}\"okay\"{/i}?"
    j "Hahaha, okay, okay... It was {i}great{/i}."
    m "*Chuckle* That's what I thought."
    m "And how about the..."
    m "Actually, I meant how was it being there without your phone."
    j "It sucked because I couldn't call you."
    m "That's sweet."
    j "Because {i}I'm{/i} sweet. See? I told you it'd go to my head."
    m "You really are sweet, babe."
    j "Awww... Thanks!"
    m "And how about the..."
m "Trip?"
j "To be honest, exhausting. I've seen so much..."
m "So much?"
j "So much {i}\"crazy\"{/i} that I'm not even sure I want to finish this study."
m "Are you supposed to call them crazy?"
j "Okay, {i}\"mentally disturbed\"{/i}. Although, this was on a whole new level."
m "Weren't you prepared for that? It is an institution for the criminally insane, after all."
j "{i}\"Prepared\"{/i}, huh?"
j "Nothing can prepare you for that. Sleeping in the same building as them, taking away our phones..."
j "Sometimes, I felt like I was in a horror movie. It was all just... too surreal."
m "For example?"
j "I'd rather not go there right now. Can we talk about something else?"
m "Sure."
j "How was college? We have so much catching up to do."
m "Oh, you know, same old..."
m "Professor Cawley is still bald and professor Naehring is still acting like a Nazi."
j "*Giggle* So, nothing's changed?"
m "Guess not."
j "And? Got anything planned for the summer? "
j "It's the last day of the semester and all."
m "I think I'll just stay here. Maybe get a summer job and chill."
j "You're not going back home?"
m "Home? Hah! Hell no."
m "You?"
j "I'm not sure. I should go visit my parents... at least for a couple of days."
j "But I don't wanna leave you again."
m "Don't worry, I get it."
j "You might be a little {i}too{/i} understanding, you know that?"
m "Umm... Uh... I guess?"
j "How about..."
j "We hang out on campus for a couple weeks then... let's go on a trip! How about... camping?"
m "You want to be alone with me in a secluded forest?"
j "What, you're gonna leave me tied up in a tree?"
m "Well... maybe not up {i}in{/i} a tree... maybe {i}to{/i} a tree."
j "Oooh... Sounds {i}fun.{/i}"
m "Don't worry. I'll take good care of you."
j "And what are you going--"
n "She's interrupted by your phone's loud ringtone."
m "Just a second."
m "Hmm. Why is she--"
j "Well? Not gonna answer?\n(There he goes again... being so vague and secretive.)"
n "You mute the phone and place it on the nightstand."
m "It's not important."
j "Why didn't you answer?"
m "I just don't feel... "
n "You are interrupted by the ringing, again."
n "So, again, you pick it up..."
j "Just answer it, [m]."
m "*Sigh*"
j "Maybe it's important."
m "I doubt it."
n "You put the phone back."
m "So for the summer, what do you wanna do firs--"
n "Interrupted again."
m "Ughh!"
n "Angrily, you pick up the phone and answer..."
m "WHAT?!"
mo "I'm so sorry to bother you this late, [m!t]."
m "Sorry for yelling. I'm in the middle of something..."
mo "I wouldn't be calling if it weren't so important."
m "What's going on?"
mo "Look... I really need your help back at camp this summer."
m "This is really last minute, Eve."
m "I'm sorry, but I've already made plans."
mo "There's been a development, and you need to come as soon as possible."
mo "I have no one else to call."
m "What {i}\"development\"{/i}? Why do you even need ME?!"
mo "{i}*I'll explain everything when you get here.*{/i}"
m "Can't I even say no?"
mo "{i}*...*{/i}"
m "I really can't come. You'll have to find someone else."
mo "{i}*I need you here, [m!t]. Tomorrow.*{/i}"
m "Tomorrow?! What the--"
mo "{i}*[m!ct], I'm depending on you.*{/i}"
j "(Seriously?! Tomorrow?!)"
m "Ugh!"
mo "{i}*I can't do this without you, [m!t]. I need someone here that I can depend on.*{/i}"
n "Trying not to blow a fuse, you stay silent."
mo "{i}*Take a bus tomorrow. There's one leaving at 5 AM.*{/i}"
m "And you only NOW decided to tell me?! Literally, six hours in advance?!"
mo "*My apprentice cancelled last minute.*"
mo "*I'll make it up to you, I promise.*"
m "Fine, I'll come."
m "But I'm really not happy about this, Eve."
mo "*You're a lifesaver, [m!t].*"
mo "*I knew I could count on you.*"
j "What happened?"
m "I... Uhh...."
j "Looks like you're going back to the camp, after all."
m "Yeah... Looks like I am..."
j "It's okay..."
m "No! It's not... We made plans."
m "I wanted to spend my summer with you."
j "Can't I come with you?"
m "Trust me, you do not want that."
j "Why not?"
m "You just don't."
j "Why? Because she runs a camp for delinquent boys?"
m "Ye-Wait... How do you know about that?"
j "Gugle? Heard of it?"
m "So you Gugled me?"
j "Hey! There are lots of creeps out there. A girl's gotta be careful nowadays."
m "So when you met me, you thought I was a creep?"
j "A bit."
m "Great..."
n "Almost jumping off the bed, she hugs you."
j "Even if you are a creep... You're a cute creep."
m "Ha-ha-ha..."
j "I knew I'd make you laugh, sooner or later."
m "It was a sarcastic laugh."
j "Still a laugh. *Giggle*"
j "I could come with you... The camp must have a shadowy forest I could camp out in, nearby."
m "I just don't think it's a good idea."
j "But why? I spent two months with the most dangerous, criminally-insane people in this country..."
j "You think I can't handle a few eighteen-year-old kleptos and non-stop masturbators?"
m "It's not about that."
j "Well, spit it out then... What is it?!"
m "I don't really wanna talk about it right now."
j "Hmm… Okay."
m "The whole situation at camp is, well... messy."
j "I can handle {i}\"messy\"{/i}."
m "I know you can, babe. I just don't want you to."
m "Tell you what, let me see how things are when I get there... and then maybe you can come visit."
m "In the meantime, you can go visit your parents."
m "You haven't seen them in months... You probably miss them a lot."
j "That's true... Though, I think they miss me more."
m "I shouldn't be there more than a week."
j "A week? Without you, hot stuff?"
m "We managed two months without seeing or hearing each other..."
m "What's a week, right? Plus, we can actually call each other and talk this time!"
j "True! What's a week?! Nothing!"
m "Okay, so we have a deal?"
j "Deal!"
m "Ugh... I should get packing..."
j "Want me to help?"
m "You're the best, babe."
j "No, no. I'm the best because... I'll do it naked! *Giggle*"
m "You truly {i}are{/i} wonderful... And, that ass of your helps, too."
j "Less talking, more packing! You need to get some sleep too."
j "Oh, and... At least for tonight, I'm sleeping with you."
m "Sounds perfect."
n "With Jane's help, you get packed..."
n "And go to bed, soon after."
n "The next morning..."
n "5 AM."
m "*Whispers* Jane..."
n "You try nudging her a little..."
j "Zzzzzz..."
m "(She must be exhausted from the trip.)"
m "(Should I wake her up?)"
    m "Hey, Jane. Wake up."
    j "Hmmph?"
    m "I have to go."
    j "Wha... Already?"
    m "Yes.\n(She looks exhausted.)"
    n "You plant a gentle kiss on her cheek..."
    m "You can go back to sleep. Call me when you wake up."
    j "Mhmmm..."
n "Standing up..."
n "You grab your bags..."
n "And make your way towards the door."
n "Before leaving, you sneak one last look at Jane."
n "And, finally, you leave."
m "*Pant* *Pant* *Pant*"
m "Just in time."
m "(Huh? Where's the bus?)"
n "Realizing the bus isn't near, you sit down."
m "(Good thing I almost busted a lung running here.)"
m "*Sigh*\n(I still don't get it...)"
m "(Why did Eve's apprentice bail on her last minute?)"
m "(I bet they didn't want to waste their entire summer there, again…)"
n "However, your thoughts are interrupted by the bus pulling into the stop."
m "(Well, here we go...)"
n "You board the empty bus..."
n "And sit down."
m "({i}Of course{/i} it's empty... No one ever takes this line...)"
n "The bus gets going and, slowly, buildings pass you by..."
m "(Leaving the city...)"
m "*Sigh*"
n "About an hour later..."
m "(Back to nature...)"
m "(Usually I like nature...)"
m "(But going back home...)"
m "(Not a fan...)"
n "Three hours later, you finally arrive."
n "Leaving the bus, you notice..."
m "(Yeah... I guess it was too much to ask for someone to pick me up.)"
m "(Better be on my way, then...)"
n "Around thirty minutes of walking later..."
n "You arrive at the entrance of the camp."
n "With a sigh, you look up."
m "(Red Falls...)"
