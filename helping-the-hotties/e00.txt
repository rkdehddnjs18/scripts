Narator: *Thunderclap*
Narator: Getting out of bed...
Narator: You slowly make your way towards the window.
Me: (It's really coming down hard.)
Me: (Hope she'll make it.)
Me: (Oh, that must be her.)
Narator: The door cracks open ever so slightly... 
Narator: Letting in a beam of bright light from the hallway.
Jane: Anyone here?
Me: Come on in, silly.
Narator: Jane steps into your room.
Narator: As she does, you can't help but admire...
Narator: Her long, slender legs...
Narator: Tight waist...
Narator: And a smile no guy could resist.
Jane: It's so dark in here, I can barely see you.
Narator: Saying this, she closes the door.
Narator: While you use the chance to move a few steps closer...
Me: Want me to turn the lights on?
Jane: No need.
Narator: Almost immediately, she leaps into your arms and kisses you.
Narator: Looking straight into your eyes...
Jane: I missed you.
Me: *Chuckle* Missed you too, babe.
Me: Wanna dry off? Here, take my shirt.
Jane: I just walked in a second ago, and you already want me to take my clothes off?
Me: Well, you {i}do{/i} look cold.
Jane: Mind warming me up then?
Narator: You share another long kiss.
Narator: After a second or two, she pushes you back a little...
Me: Better?
Jane: Not quite.
Jane: You'll have to do a {i}little bit{/i} better.
Narator: Before you can respond, she pulls off her shirt.
Me: No bra?
Jane: I was in a hurry to get here.
Jane: Wait, are you complaining?
Me: Does that sound like a complaint?
Jane: {i}A bit{/i}.
Narator: Slowly, Jane moves towards the center of the room...
Jane: I missed being here, in your dorm room.
Me: Well, you were gone for two months.
Jane: I know...
Jane: Sorry for leaving like that...
Me: Don't worry about it. I mean, it really was a great opportunity. 
Narator: Getting closer...
Me: Tell me all about it?
Jane: You seriously wanna talk about mental patients now? 
Jane: When I'm standing in the middle of your room, half naked?
Me: Point taken.
Jane: Good.
Narator: All of a sudden...
Narator: Jane pushes you...
Narator: Causing you to stumble and fall onto your bed.
Narator: Slowly...
Narator: Jane prowls towards you...
Narator: And pulls down your pants.
Jane: Looks like you really did miss me.
Narator: With a smile, she gets down on her knees.
Narator: Wrapping her soft hand around your cock...
Narator: She slowly starts stroking.
Jane: God, I've missed this...
Me: Me too...
Narator: Unable to stop herself, she starts playfully licking your tip.
Jane: Mmmm...
Narator: Getting more than excited, soon enough...
Narator: She slides her lips onto your cock...
Me: *Groan*
Jane: *Giggle* *Slurp*
Narator: Obviously enjoying your reactions, she continues...
Narator: Swallowing more of your length.
Jane: *Gglg*
Me: This feels more than perfect, babe...
Jane: *Gglg* *Slurp* Mhhmmm...
Me: Come here.
Narator: A bit surprised, Jane pulls your cock out of her mouth.
Jane: What? It's not good?
Me: No, it's great! I just...
Me: To be honest, I can't wait to fuck you.
Narator: Saying nothing at first, she stands up...
Jane: Oh? You can't?
Me: *Nod*
Narator: Sensually, she unbuttons her pants...
Narator: And slides them off.
Me: You are beautiful.
Jane: Don't say that... It'll go to my head.
Narator: Continuing where she left off, Jane starts taking off her panties.
Me: It definitely should go to your head. You're the most perfect girl I know.
Narator: Finally, Jane is standing in front of you... completely naked.
Jane: Oh? You really think so?
Me: I {i}know{/i} so.
Narator: Playfully, she jumps onto you.
Narator: Grabbing your cock and placing it on her ass.
Narator: She starts grinding against your shaft...
Narator: Her every move sending jolts down your entire body.
Narator: As she raises her hips, your cock slides underneath her...
Narator: Stopping perfectly, right at the entrance of her pussy.
Jane: I want you to fuck me really hard.
Narator: And in one swift motion...
Narator: She impales herself onto your rock-hard cock.
Me: Oh, fuck!
Narator: Her completely soaked pussy easily sliding around your rod...
Narator: Slowly moving her hips, Jane starts riding you.
Jane: *Moan* That's it...
Jane: Mmmm...
Jane: *Moan* So good.
Me: (She did say {i}\"fuck me real hard\"{/i}...)
Narator: And so you do.
Jane: *Moan* Mmm-ahh!
Jane: Y-Yes...

Jane: *Moan* Ahhh... Fuck, YES! Mmm...
Jane: So... Fucking... GOOD!
Jane: Fuck my little pussy! Hard-Ahh!
Jane: Yes! Harder! I want you to fuck me harder!
Narator: More than happy to fulfill her desire... You grab her ass with both hands...
Narator: And start slamming your whole length into her...
Jane: OHH, FUCK ME! That's it! *Moan*
Jane: Fuck-Fuck-Fuck! AAAHH!
Jane: Yes! AHH! Mmmm... AHH!
Jane: So fucking... Ahhh! DON'T STOP!
Jane: Yes! KEEP GO-AHH! JUST LIKE THAT!
Jane: Shit! So good! Ahh!
Jane: I'm cumming! I'm cumming!
Jane: DON'T STOP! DON'T STOP! DON'T ST-AAAAAHHH!
Jane: *Screams* FUUUCK!!!
Narator: Her whole body tenses up, quivering as if you're shaking her...
Jane: FUCKING... AHHHHHHHH!
Narator: Following that long, pleasure-filled scream, Jane collapses onto your chest.
Jane: *Pant* Pheww… I needed this sooo badly...
Me: *Chuckle* I believe you. That was fast.
Jane: Shush, you! There are no words to describe how horny I was.
Jane: *Long breath* Want me to get on my back?
Me: Already? You don't need a break?
Narator: Before answering, she straightens up, with you still inside her.

Jane: Oh, we are not done here, mister. Not by a long shot...
Narator: She sprawls onto the bed.
Narator: And, as she does...
Narator: She slowly spreads her legs.
Jane: You coming?
Narator: Without wasting a second, you jump into position.
Me: You don't have to ask me twice.
Jane: Uhhh... *Moan*
Jane: Ahhh... Mmmm...
Jane: *Moan* Harder...
Me: Fuck, it feels so amazing!
Jane: Ahh! Yes, it fucking does!
Jane: Ahhh! *Moan* More!
Me: I love watching your perfect tits bounce.
Jane: And I-Aaah! I love your cock! Ooh... *Moan*
Me: (I don't know how I managed to keep going without this for two months.)
Me: (I mean, look at her! Fuck! She's SO fucking hot!)
Jane: YES! Fuck! *Moan* Mmmm...
Me: (I can't take it anymore... I gotta feel her boobs.)
Jane: Ahh! Yes! *Moan* Mmmm...
Jane: Fuck! Fuck me! Yes! Gaaahh!
Me: (Her tits are so soft!)
Jane: Harder! *Moan* I want you to fuck me harder!
Jane: Fuck me stupid! Pound me like a slut! Aaahh!
Me: (I love when she talks dirty like this.)
Jane: Ahhh! Yes! Fuck! Mmm-AAH!
Narator: Not stopping, even for a moment...
Narator: Almost aggressively, you grab both her legs and lift them up
Jane: Woah!
Me: *Chuckle* You asked for it!
Jane: Ohhh! Fuck! Yes! AHH!
Jane: Shit! Fuck, YES!
Jane: Fuck me! YES! MORE!
Jane: *Moan* I'm gonna cum again! Shit!
Jane: Mmmm-Ahh! Yes!
Narator: Her legs start trembling in your hands...
Narator: An orgasm completely washing over her.
Jane: OH MY GOD!!!
Jane: *Pant* Wow... Did you practice while I was away? *Giggle*
Me: Hahahah! Good one.
Me: You know I'd never cheat on you.
Jane: I know, silly. I'm just joking.
Me: On a more important note...
Me: How about you turn around?
Jane: You mean...
Jane: {i}Like this?{/i}
Me: Exactly like that!
Narator: You immediately position your cock less than an inch away from her pussy.
Narator: And gently push it inside.
Jane: *Moan*
Jane: I love this position! Mmmm...
Jane: It hits-Ahh! It hits just right!
Jane: *Moan* Yes!
Narator: Soon, you pick up the pace.
Jane: Ahhh! Fuck, yes! Mmmm...
Jane: Fuck me! Fuck me!
Jane: I want you to cum for me, baby.
Jane: A-Ahhh! Fuck! It's hitting so deep!
Narator: Hearing this, you grab Jane's hands...
Jane: Huh?!
Me: And now it'll go in even deeper...
Jane: OH, FUCK!
Jane: Shit! YES! AAAHH!
Jane: AHHH! FUCK!!! AAAH!!!
Jane: I'M GONNA-FUCK! AHHH!!! DON'T STOP!!!
Jane: *Pant* I'M GONNA CUM AGAIN!
Me: I'm close too!
Jane: MMHMM! CUM FOR ME! *moan*
Jane: *Moan* A-AAAH! AAAAAHHH!!!
Narator: As you let go of Jane’s arms, she falls onto the bed.
Narator: You cum all over her ass, and back.
Narator: She is squirming through her third orgasm, now.
Narator: Exhausted, you collapse onto the bed next to her.
Jane: *Pant* *Pant* Phew...
Me: *Pant* *Cough* {i}\"Phew\"{/i}, indeed.
Narator: Turning your head towards her...
Narator: There was just enough light to see her beautiful face.
Jane: I like you a lot, [m!t].
Me: Thanks… You’re also kinda the best.
Narator: A satisfied smile forms on her face.
Narator: Suddenly changing the subject...
Jane: The weather outside is crazy.
Me: To put it mildly, yeah.
Narator: Not really feeling like talking about weather... You change the subject.
Me: So? I'm listening now. How was it?
Jane: *Chuckle* The sex or the trip?
Jane: *Chuckle* The sex or the trip?
    Me: *Chuckle* The sex, of course. *chuckle*
    Jane: Sex was, ummm... Okay-ish.
    Me: {i}\"Okay-ish\"{/i}?
    Jane: Yeah, it was okay.
    Me: Really? Just {i}\"okay\"{/i}?
    Jane: Hahaha, okay, okay... It was {i}great{/i}.
    Me: *Chuckle* That's what I thought.
    Me: And how about the...
    Me: Actually, I meant how was it being there without your phone.
    Jane: It sucked because I couldn't call you.
    Me: That's sweet.
    Jane: Because {i}I'm{/i} sweet. See? I told you it'd go to my head.
    Me: You really are sweet, babe.
    Jane: Awww... Thanks!
    Me: And how about the...
Me: Trip?
Jane: To be honest, exhausting. I've seen so much...
Me: So much?
Jane: So much {i}\"crazy\"{/i} that I'm not even sure I want to finish this study.
Me: Are you supposed to call them crazy?
Jane: Okay, {i}\"mentally disturbed\"{/i}. Although, this was on a whole new level.
Me: Weren't you prepared for that? It is an institution for the criminally insane, after all.
Jane: {i}\"Prepared\"{/i}, huh?
Jane: Nothing can prepare you for that. Sleeping in the same building as them, taking away our phones...
Jane: Sometimes, I felt like I was in a horror movie. It was all just... too surreal.
Me: For example?
Jane: I'd rather not go there right now. Can we talk about something else?
Me: Sure.
Jane: How was college? We have so much catching up to do.
Me: Oh, you know, same old...
Me: Professor Cawley is still bald and professor Naehring is still acting like a Nazi.
Jane: *Giggle* So, nothing's changed?
Me: Guess not.
Jane: And? Got anything planned for the summer? 
Jane: It's the last day of the semester and all.
Me: I think I'll just stay here. Maybe get a summer job and chill.
Jane: You're not going back home?
Me: Home? Hah! Hell no.
Me: You?
Jane: I'm not sure. I should go visit my parents... at least for a couple of days.
Jane: But I don't wanna leave you again.
Me: Don't worry, I get it.
Jane: You might be a little {i}too{/i} understanding, you know that?
Me: Umm... Uh... I guess?
Jane: How about...
Jane: We hang out on campus for a couple weeks then... let's go on a trip! How about... camping?
Me: You want to be alone with me in a secluded forest?
Jane: What, you're gonna leave me tied up in a tree?
Me: Well... maybe not up {i}in{/i} a tree... maybe {i}to{/i} a tree.
Jane: Oooh... Sounds {i}fun.{/i}
Me: Don't worry. I'll take good care of you.
Jane: And what are you going--
Narator: She's interrupted by your phone's loud ringtone.
Me: Just a second.
Me: Hmm. Why is she--
Jane: Well? Not gonna answer?\n(There he goes again... being so vague and secretive.)
Narator: You mute the phone and place it on the nightstand.
Me: It's not important.
Jane: Why didn't you answer?
Me: I just don't feel... 
Narator: You are interrupted by the ringing, again.
Narator: So, again, you pick it up...
Jane: Just answer it, [m].
Me: *Sigh*
Jane: Maybe it's important.
Me: I doubt it.
Narator: You put the phone back.
Me: So for the summer, what do you wanna do firs--
Narator: Interrupted again.
Me: Ughh!
Narator: Angrily, you pick up the phone and answer...
Me: WHAT?!
Eve: I'm so sorry to bother you this late, [m!t].
Me: Sorry for yelling. I'm in the middle of something...
Eve: I wouldn't be calling if it weren't so important.
Me: What's going on?
Eve: Look... I really need your help back at camp this summer.
Me: This is really last minute, Eve.
Me: I'm sorry, but I've already made plans.
Eve: There's been a development, and you need to come as soon as possible.
Eve: I have no one else to call.
Me: What {i}\"development\"{/i}? Why do you even need ME?!
Eve: {i}*I'll explain everything when you get here.*{/i}
Me: Can't I even say no?
Eve: {i}*...*{/i}
Me: I really can't come. You'll have to find someone else.
Eve: {i}*I need you here, [m!t]. Tomorrow.*{/i}
Me: Tomorrow?! What the--
Eve: {i}*[m!ct], I'm depending on you.*{/i}
Jane: (Seriously?! Tomorrow?!)
Me: Ugh!
Eve: {i}*I can't do this without you, [m!t]. I need someone here that I can depend on.*{/i}
Narator: Trying not to blow a fuse, you stay silent.
Eve: {i}*Take a bus tomorrow. There's one leaving at 5 AM.*{/i}
Me: And you only NOW decided to tell me?! Literally, six hours in advance?!
Eve: *My apprentice cancelled last minute.*
Eve: *I'll make it up to you, I promise.*
Me: Fine, I'll come.
Me: But I'm really not happy about this, Eve.
Eve: *You're a lifesaver, [m!t].*
Eve: *I knew I could count on you.*
Jane: What happened?
Me: I... Uhh....
Jane: Looks like you're going back to the camp, after all.
Me: Yeah... Looks like I am...
Jane: It's okay...
Me: No! It's not... We made plans.
Me: I wanted to spend my summer with you.
Jane: Can't I come with you?
Me: Trust me, you do not want that.
Jane: Why not?
Me: You just don't.
Jane: Why? Because she runs a camp for delinquent boys?
Me: Ye-Wait... How do you know about that?
Jane: Gugle? Heard of it?
Me: So you Gugled me?
Jane: Hey! There are lots of creeps out there. A girl's gotta be careful nowadays.
Me: So when you met me, you thought I was a creep?
Jane: A bit.
Me: Great...
Narator: Almost jumping off the bed, she hugs you.
Jane: Even if you are a creep... You're a cute creep.
Me: Ha-ha-ha...
Jane: I knew I'd make you laugh, sooner or later.
Me: It was a sarcastic laugh.
Jane: Still a laugh. *Giggle*
Jane: I could come with you... The camp must have a shadowy forest I could camp out in, nearby.
Me: I just don't think it's a good idea.
Jane: But why? I spent two months with the most dangerous, criminally-insane people in this country...
Jane: You think I can't handle a few eighteen-year-old kleptos and non-stop masturbators?
Me: It's not about that.
Jane: Well, spit it out then... What is it?!
Me: I don't really wanna talk about it right now.
Jane: Hmm… Okay.
Me: The whole situation at camp is, well... messy.
Jane: I can handle {i}\"messy\"{/i}.
Me: I know you can, babe. I just don't want you to.
Me: Tell you what, let me see how things are when I get there... and then maybe you can come visit.
Me: In the meantime, you can go visit your parents.
Me: You haven't seen them in months... You probably miss them a lot.
Jane: That's true... Though, I think they miss me more.
Me: I shouldn't be there more than a week.
Jane: A week? Without you, hot stuff?
Me: We managed two months without seeing or hearing each other...
Me: What's a week, right? Plus, we can actually call each other and talk this time!
Jane: True! What's a week?! Nothing!
Me: Okay, so we have a deal?
Jane: Deal!
Me: Ugh... I should get packing...
Jane: Want me to help?
Me: You're the best, babe.
Jane: No, no. I'm the best because... I'll do it naked! *Giggle*
Me: You truly {i}are{/i} wonderful... And, that ass of your helps, too.
Jane: Less talking, more packing! You need to get some sleep too.
Jane: Oh, and... At least for tonight, I'm sleeping with you.
Me: Sounds perfect.
Narator: With Jane's help, you get packed...
Narator: And go to bed, soon after.
Narator: The next morning...
Narator: 5 AM.
Me: *Whispers* Jane...
Narator: You try nudging her a little...
Jane: Zzzzzz...
Me: (She must be exhausted from the trip.)
Me: (Should I wake her up?)
    Me: Hey, Jane. Wake up.
    Jane: Hmmph?
    Me: I have to go.
    Jane: Wha... Already?
    Me: Yes.\n(She looks exhausted.)
    Narator: You plant a gentle kiss on her cheek...
    Me: You can go back to sleep. Call me when you wake up.
    Jane: Mhmmm...
Narator: Standing up...
Narator: You grab your bags...
Narator: And make your way towards the door.
Narator: Before leaving, you sneak one last look at Jane.
Narator: And, finally, you leave.
Me: *Pant* *Pant* *Pant*
Me: Just in time.
Me: (Huh? Where's the bus?)
Narator: Realizing the bus isn't near, you sit down.
Me: (Good thing I almost busted a lung running here.)
Me: *Sigh*\n(I still don't get it...)
Me: (Why did Eve's apprentice bail on her last minute?)
Me: (I bet they didn't want to waste their entire summer there, again…)
Narator: However, your thoughts are interrupted by the bus pulling into the stop.
Me: (Well, here we go...)
Narator: You board the empty bus...
Narator: And sit down.
Me: ({i}Of course{/i} it's empty... No one ever takes this line...)
Narator: The bus gets going and, slowly, buildings pass you by...
Me: (Leaving the city...)
Me: *Sigh*
Narator: About an hour later...
Me: (Back to nature...)
Me: (Usually I like nature...)
Me: (But going back home...)
Me: (Not a fan...)
Narator: Three hours later, you finally arrive.
Narator: Leaving the bus, you notice...
Me: (Yeah... I guess it was too much to ask for someone to pick me up.)
Me: (Better be on my way, then...)
Narator: Around thirty minutes of walking later...
Narator: You arrive at the entrance of the camp.
Narator: With a sigh, you look up.
Me: (Red Falls...)
