n You noticed all the red flags.
n Emily's jaw hurt...
n Her knees were red and slightly bruised...
n In your mind, there was no one else it could have been.
n Emily MUST be the \"Forest Sucker!\"
m IT WAS YOU!
m (It must be her... All the evidence points to her!)
m IT WAS YOU, WASNâ€™T IT?
em What the hell are you talking about, [m!t]?
em (I mean, I like it when [m!t] pays attention to me... but not like this.)
m No need to be coy about it!
m (Never thought Emily could... Blowjob aside, tying me up was too much...)
m (Wonder how she would have felt if she was in the same situation...)
em [m!ct], you're really starting to scare me...
m How could you?! You {i}KNOW{/i} I'm seeing someone!
em You're really freaking me out...
em I don't have to deal with accusations like this!
n With that, Emily ran to her room and slammed the door...
n ...calling Eve's attention to the ruckus happening upstairs.
mo What the hell is going on here, [m!t]?!
mo Why are you screaming at Emily like that?
m It's... nothing. She just messed with my stuff.
mo Do you think that's the mature way to resolve something like that?
mo I won't tolerate fighting in my house.
mo You can do better, [m!t]. I'm sure of it.
mo You're going to do some morning chores...
mo ...as your apology for screaming at Emily.
mo You'll begin by sweeping the Community Area's deck...
mo Then you'll clean up the fire pit...
mo Ending with cleaning the lake of all fallen leaves and debris. 
mo We'll need it clean for tomorrow's activities.
m Okay...
m (I'd rather not talk back...)
m (I don't want Eve asking any more questions about why I was yelling at Emily.)
mo Do you understand what you'll be doing?
m Yeah... I'll wake up early and get it done.
mo Good. You better get to sleep soon.
mo Goodnight.
m (I'm so pissed off...)
m (Emily escaped before I could confirm that she's the \"Forest Sucker\"...)
m (Eve roasted me and gave me even more work than usual...)
m (I can barely sleep after all this bullshit...)
    m (I can barely sleep after all this bullshit...)
        m (What a {i}great{/i} day...)
        m (It's just an endless chain of weird and wild...
        m (...and I'm caught up in it all.)
        m (I could really use a bit of shut-eye...)
        m Goodnight, Camp Crazy.
        n With that, you enter your room and head straight to bed.
        n However, you consider calling Jane before you head off to sleep.
        n Everything that happened today has wound you up...
        n So much that you needed to go outside and get some air before sleep.
        n You exit the house and stroll around the camp for some time.
        n Eventually, you make your way to the most relaxing area of camp.
        n The dock.
        n However, upon arriving at the dock, you realize it's already occupied...
        n By Eve.
        m Hey, Eve.
        mo Came to clear your head a bit?
        m Yeah. I'm sorry for my outburst. Should have handled it better.
        mo Just make sure it doesn't happen again.
        mo Conflicts shouldn't be resolved with foul words.
        m I know...
        mo Come, sit down. Let's talk.
        m (Eve really knows how to comfort people...)
            mo Come here, sit down...
            mo You can even have another cigarette if you'd like.
            mo I won't stop you.
            n You smile at Eve coyly as you take a cigarette from the pack beside her.
            m Got a light?
            mo Of course... Here.
            m (Since Eve and I are here alone... 
            m (...it seems like the perfect opportunity to ask.)
            m Is there something bothering you, Eve?
            mo *Quietly sighs* You're more clever than you let on.
            m Am I?
            m I thought I was the guy who could never learn simple etiquette...
            m Like knocking before entering.
            mo *Chuckles* Well, you're right about that. But, seriously... Clever.
            m You can tell me. Whatever it is...
            mo I don't want to bother you with these things.
            mo This is something I need to work on. By myself.
            m Hearing someone else's opinion might help.
            mo It's all these changes that have been happening...
            mo I feel like I've started to lose focus.
            mo I know you've noticed.
            m Huh?
            mo That's sweet of you, pretending like you haven't.
            m Is there any way I can help with whatever you're struggling with?
            mo The patients are a bit more difficult than I've expected.
            mo I've been having a hard time managing all this by myself.
            mo So, I've been thinking...
            m About?
            mo Well... I'd like you to take on more responsibility at camp.
            mo You would do therapy work with the patients.
            mo You'd start small. But, eventually, you'll be given more work.
            m Oh... Wow. I really wasn't expecting this. I'd be honored, Eve.
            mo Good.
            mo Well then... I'm looking forward seeing you in action.
            m Thanks, Eve.
            m The fresh air, and your company, helped.
            n You finish the rest of your cigarette in silence, looking up at the stars above the forest.
            n You put out the cigarette, and head off toward the house.
            n But, not before saying goodbye to Eve.
            m Goodnight, Eve.
            mo Goodnight, [m!t].
            mo Sit down.
            m Yes, ma'am.
            mo Good.
            mo You know I'm smoking more of these because of all the stress you're causing me?
            m I'm sorry...
            mo I know you are, but you need to get your head straight.
            m I know, The Guidelines...
            mo They exist for a reason, [m!t].
            mo Mostly, to protect us from lawsuits.
            mo Also, to protect the girls from harm.
            m I understand...
            mo {i}Do you?{/i}
            mo You say you do, yet you keep fucking around.
            m (Eve is really roasting me on a spit right now...)
            mo Just... be more considerate. Don't lose your head.
            m I will, Eve. I'm sorry it even came to this.
            mo *Exhales deeply* It's okay. I forgive you.
            m Thanks, Eve.
            mo Look, there's also something else I've been wanting to tell you.
            mo And now that I've given you a harsh reprimand... 
            mo I think I should alleviate some of your worries.
            mo I've been thinking...
            m Huh?
            mo I'd like you to take on more responsibility at camp.
            m In what way?
            mo You would do therapy work with the patients.
            mo I've been having a hard time managing everything by myself.
            mo You'd start small. But, eventually, you'll be given more work.
            m Oh... Wow. I really wasn't expecting this. I'd be honored, Eve.
            mo Thank you so much, [m!t].
            mo You're really stepping up this year...
            mo I guess college has made you more mature.
            m Perhaps. I'm starting to enjoy this, actually.
            mo Good.
            m I think I've gotten enough fresh air. I'm heading to bed.
            mo Goodnight, [m!t].
            m Goodnight, Eve.
        n A quiet has fallen on the camp, and the house, as you get back to your room.
        n Everyone is likely sleeping, and here you are wondering what to do...
        m (I feel bad about how little Jane and I have spoken since I got here...)
        m (Maybe I should give her a call before sleep?)
        n Holding the phone in your hand, you contemplate calling Jane.
        m (I know it's late, but I still think she'd appreciate it if I call her.)
        n As the phone rings, you think about Jane.
        n How sweet she is.
        n How sexy she looks when she's wearing lingerie...
        n And... the last time you two fucked.
        m (Huh, her phone's still ringing.)
        m (Why isn't she picking up?)
        n Alas, your phone's dial tone cuts, and you're sent to voicemail.
        m (Oh well, I guess she's sleeping.)
        m (I'll message her to let her know it wasn't anything urgent.)
        m (Then I should really get some sleep...)
        m *Yawn* (Tomorrow is going to be a long day.)
        m (It's pretty late. She's probably sleeping anyway.)
        m (I think it would be better if I just send her a message before I head off to sleep.)
        n After your message is sent, you wait to see if she'll see it.
        n After waiting 10 minutes, you decide to leave her be.
        m (Yeah, looks like she's sleeping.)
        m (I should really go to sleep too.)
        m *Yawn* (Tomorrow is going to be a long day.)
n You hear your phone's alarm going off. It must be 4am.
m *Yawn* I think this is the earliest I've woken up since arriving here...
m I {i}really{/i} didn't need this.
m (She doesn't even know why I was yelling at Emily!)
m (But... if she knew, my life would be so much more fucked.)
n You sit up, tired from such a short sleep.
n Despite your grogginess, you still remember to check your phone.
m (Maybe Jane responded?)
n She didn't.
n But, that doesn't bother you.
n Your only thought right now is to go downstairs.
n And, hopefully have some coffee before starting the day's tasks.
m (I hope the coffee machine is prepped.)
m (Eve always has it ready for the next morning.)
m (\"Push a button and 'voila!'\" as she always says.)
n You make your way down the darkened stairwell.
n Making sure to walk quietly.
m (I should also make sure not to trip. It's pretty damn dark.)
n You make it to the kitchen without killing yourself, or waking anyone.
n Quickly, you make yourself a cup of coffee and drink it before going to do your chores.
m *Sip* (What were they, again?)
m (Eve said to sweep the Community Area's deck and clean the fire pit, first.)
m (Better get started.)
n Standing beside the fire pit, you notice a bucket and small shovel.
m (Thankfully Eve made my job a bit easier by leaving the tools here.)
n You get to work cleaning the fire pit, but can't help yourself...
n You begin thinking about Stacy.
n What she'd say about the ashes you're sweeping away.
m *Mimicking Stacy's voice* \"Gracious. Passing fine ash thou'st given.\"
m *Mimicking Stacy's voice* \"Let this ash bestow nourishment...\"
n You begin getting carried away, imagining more... sultry images of Stacy.
s Come to me, [m!t]...
s Embrace me like the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus embraces her flock.
n Lost in your imagination, you embrace Stacy.
n Only, after a moment you realize both of you are naked.
n But, it doesn't matter.
n You begin kissing her perky breasts...
n Imagining her body twitching as you do.
n Her body is hot... She's hungry for you...
n You could spend eternity like this...
n With her. Waiting, eager... for you to play.
n Until you snap back to reality.
n Realizing you've finished your task and have a hard-on.
m Oh, I'm done.
m (Ah shit, morning wood?)
m (I better get back to work. That's sure to kill this unwanted boner.)
    m (Now that I'm done cleaning the fire pit...
    m (There's only one chore left.)
    m (Which chores do I have left?)
    m Oh yeah.
    m (I needed to clean the Community Area's deck, then the lake at sunrise.)
n At the Community Center's deck, you notice a broom leaned against the wall.
m (Ah, perfect! A broom.)
m (But, what the hell?)
m (Eve thought making me do these chores in the dark would teach me something?)
m (I'm more likely to get dragged away into the woods...
m (...by Hector... than...)
m *Shudders* (Better that I don't think about {i}that{/i} story.)
    n Lost in thought, but on auto-pilot, you finish sweeping the deck.
    m Nice. I'm done!
    n Lost in thought, but on auto-pilot, you finish sweeping the deck.
    m Nice. I'm done!
    m (Now that I'm done cleaning the deck...
    m (There's only one chore left.)
    m (Which chores do I have left?)
    m (Oh yeah. I needed to clean the fire pit, then the lake at sunrise.)
m (Looks like the sun has finally started rising.)
m (So, I guess I should head to the lake, then.)
n You head over to the lake to start your final chore.
m Where's the cleaning net?
n You see a net on a long pole resting on the dock, clearly left for you by Eve.
m Again, Eve helped me by leaving the tools here.
n You begin to scoop the floating leaves and twigs off the surface of the lake.
m *Grunt* I really am the workhorse here.
m (Actually, I'm more like the janitor...)
m (Doing all the dirty jobs no one else would do.)
n Your thoughts on the kinds of jobs you do at Red Falls are suddenly interrupted...
v Hey, [m!t]! You're up early!
n ...which startles you...
m WOAH! Shi--
n ...causing you to fall into the lake.
v Oh my god! [m!t], are you okay?
m Ah! The lake is freezing!
m I'm okay. I'm okay. Just a human popsicle at the moment.
v Here, let me help you out.
    n Violet gently helps you out of the lake.
    n You're soaked from head to toe.
    m *Shivers* Why'd you spook me like that, Violet?
    v I didn't mean to, really...
    v I came here to do my usual morning yoga routine.
    n The thought of Violet doing yoga, like a few days prior, floods your mind.
    n You imagine her in lewd positions, almost begging you to come closer.
    n And, in seconds, you get a hard-on.
    m (Oh fuck, she'll definitely see {i}this{/i} in wet pants...)
    v (Why did [m!t] get so quiet all of a sudden? Is he...)
    v (What?! His dick is hard?!)
    v Umm... I'd suggest that you join me in my morning yoga, but...
    v You look like you could use a hot shower and a change of clothes.
    m *Shivers* I definitely could. I'm freezing...
    m (A hot shower would help clear my mind of intrusive thoughts, too...)
    m Thanks for helping me out of the lake.
    m But, I think I'll take a rain check on that yoga, Violet.
    v Anytime... Just don't make it a regular thing. Okay?
    m I don't plan on it.
    n Violet contemplates helping you out of the water, but she remembers the clap.
    v On second thought...
    v It is pretty funny to see your clumsiness get the better of you.
    n Violet watches as you tread water in the lake, shivering.
    m Could you help me out?
    v Hmm...
    v Maaaybeee...
    v Fine. I think you've been in there long enough.
    n Violet grabs you by the wrist and hoists you out of the water in one swift motion.
    m (Jesus! With that strength I'm lucky she didn't rip my arm off!)
    m You really are fit, Violet.
    v Thanks. I'm committed to being in peak form.
    n You can tell Violet is still upset with you...
    n ...but her heart is beginning to forgive you.
    v I'd offer you the chance to join me in my morning yoga routine...
    v ...but you're soaking wet.
    m Yeah, and now my arm is sore.
    v *Giggle* Did I pull your arm too hard? Sorry!
    m It's okay, but you're right.
    m I should head back to the house and get changed.
    v See ya later... If you don't catch a cold by then.
    m I'll be fine. See you later, Violet.
n With that, you leave Violet to her morning yoga as you walk back to the house.
n You're leaving a trail behind you from the droplets falling off your waterlogged clothes.
m There's always something, huh?
m (Why can't everything just go as planned?)
m (Maybe I'm hexed.)
m (I wouldn't put it past Stacy to try some ritual on me while I'm sleeping.)
m (Ah, what the hell am I talking about? She's a nice girl.)
n You make it back to the house on auto-pilot, and lost in thought as always.
n But, despite your distraction...
n ...you still make it upstairs to your bedroom.
n As you're about to grab a change of clean clothes, you think to yourself.
m (I should probably check my phone...)
m Still nothing? Where is she?
n You toss your phone on the bed in frustration.
n Leaving the room to go take a shower.
m (A shower will relax me.)
n You put your folded clothes on the sink counter.
n Removing your wet clothes first, you then enter the shower.
m Finally some peace.
n However, that peace didn't last long.
n While you're showering, you hear a faint tapping noise.
n You're suddenly overcome by a strange feeling...
n The feeling of being watched.
n You turn around to look at the window behind you, but you don't see anyone.
m Is someone there?
m How would anyone be creeping on me from the second floor window, anyway?
m *Chuckle* (I need to quit being so paranoid.)
m (The girls don't have super-powers.)
n You relax, and let your mind wander.
n As you do...
n Memories of Jane and the hot sex you had together floods your mind.
n Oddly, so do nude visions of Violet.
m (I need to finish my shower.)
    m (But, maybe I have enough time for a quick fap...)
        n Your hand moves down to stroke your cock to these visions.
        m (Oh yeah, Jane...)
        m (Fuck, you're so sexy!)
        n Transitioning from memory to fantasy...
            n Transitioning from memory to fantasy...
                n You imagine sliding your huge cock down Jane's throat.
                m (Suck it... yeah...)
                j Do you {i}liiiike{/i} that?
                m ({i}Fuck yeah{/i} I like that...)
                n Your imaginary Jane is taking your dick deep...
                n Deeper down her throat than you've experienced before.
                m (Oh shit. This is so kinky...)
                n You imagine the hot, wet feeling of her mouth wrapped around you.
                m (Fuck! You're too good, Jane.)
                n It's all so real to you that you even feel her tongue...
                n Sliding up and down your shaft.
                m Oh yeah... keep sucking...
                m Like that... Yeah...
                n The thought brings you closer and closer to climax.
                n As Jane eagerly awaits your hot load.
                j I'm ready, [m!t]. In my mouth...
                j Down my throat!
                n You imagine grabbing Jane by the head...
                n Shoving your cock down her throat.
                m (Take it all! Don't miss a drop!)
                j *Muffled* Mmmpph. Mmm... Aah!
                j Thanks, [m!t]... You really give me everything.
                n You imagine Jane standing in your dorm room in front of you.
                m (I wonder where this will go?)
                j I want you to take charge, [m!t].
                j Grab me...
                m Yeah? Then what?
                j Bend me over... and fuck me in the ass.
                m Hmm... I don't know...
                j Do I have to beg?
                m I think you might.
                n Jane bends over on the bed, showing her bare ass to you.
                j Please, [m!t]...
                j Pleeease...
                j Please, please... Fuck me in the ass.
                n Your cock gets rock hard, both in imagination and reality.
                m That's all you had to say.
                n You imagine poking her ass with the tip of your cock.
                j Pleeease. [m!t], stop teasing me.
                j I {i}begged{/i} for you. Please, give it to me!
                m (I can't resist any longer!)
                n You stop teasing Jane and shove it in her ass.
                j *Moans* AAAHH! Mmmm...
                j It's so big... I don't know if I can take it.
                m I believe... in you.
                n You slide your dick into and out of her ass.
                n Each time, getting deeper and deeper.
                j Oh yeah... Give it to me, [m!t]!
                n Soon, you're giving her everything...
                m (Balls... deep.)
                n You feel something rising inside you... 
                n You can't hold it much longer...
                m Get ready, Jane.
                j Givee it to me. I want you to fill me up.
                n You explode, pumping Jane's imaginary ass full of your hot cum.
                m (Take it all! I'll fill you up!)
                j OOOooohhh... I feel so warm... inside.
                j Thanks, [m!t]... You really give me {i}everything{/i}.
                n You finish your shower and put the clothes on hastily, but have already wasted a lot of time.
                m (Shit, I hope I'm not late to Eve's morning briefing...)
                n As you make it downstairs, your fears are confirmed.
                n Eve gives you a look, clearly disapproving of your tardiness.
                mo In the future, I expect you all to be on time.
                m Sorry, I must have fallen asleep a little bit while I was in there.
                k (Haha, yeah right. It sure didn't sound like that.)
                m I haven't woken up this early in a while...
                m I was half asleep the whole morning.
                mo We've waited long enough as it is, [m!t]... So, let's begin.
        n Your mind can't help but wander...
        n Back to those visions of Violet.
        n You imagine Violet doing yoga... nude.
        m (Violet, doing kinky yoga again? How naughty...)
        n And, as you imagine Violet in situations out of her character...
        n You become hornier and hornier.
        n As if your hand were possessed, you vigorously stroke your cock.
        m (Oh, yeah... Violet, you're so fit.)
        m (I bet you give a great handjob...)
        n Your fantastical vision of Violet changes abruptly.
        n She is no longer doing yoga, but has become entranced by your girthy member.
        v Oh, wow... [m!t]. Is that...
        v ...for me?
        m (I know you're shy, Violet...)
        m (So you don't need to do anything you're not comfortable with...)
        m (But, yes. It's because of, and {i}for{/i} you.)
        v Sssh. Just... let me...
        n You imagine Violet stroking your cock passionately.
        n Making you harder than before, and bringing you to the edge of climax.
        m (Violet, if you keep doing that I'll...)
        v Good. Let it out. Give it to me, on my tits...
        n Unable to wait a moment longer, your imaginary Violet takes your hot load.
        m Ahh... fuck. I really need to cool it with the fantasies...
        m (Better not... I've already been in the shower a while.)
        m (Someone could wake up soon, and need the bathroom.)
        n A little while later you finish up your shower.
        n But, you never truly shook that feeling of being watched.
        m *Shiver* It's not even October... Yet, this camp has a creepy atmosphere.
        m (Maybe it's haunted?)
        m (Heh, yeah right.)
        n You get dressed and exit the bathroom.
        n Hearing the TV on in the living room, you go downstairs to see who's there.
        n Kiara, hearing someone descending the stairs, turns the TV off to greet you.
        k Oh, good morning [m!t]. Did you sleep well?
        m I slept okay.
        k (I wonder if he had erotic dreams about me.)
        m I did have to wake up pretty early, though.
        k It's still so early in the morning...
        m I woke up at 4 am... and I just recently finished Eve's chores.
        k What? Eve made you wake up that early to do chores?
        m Yeah...
        k I'm sorry to hear that.
        k Anyway... [m!t]. I'm really glad we had that talk last night.
        m (What the hell?! Is she trying to make me uncomfortable?)
        m Me too, Kiara. But, I'm still conflicted about that...
        k It's because of Jane right?
        m Jane? Why would you-
        n Before you and Kiara can continue your discussion, you both hear someone enter the front door.
mo Good morning Red Falls staff.
k Good morning, Eve.
m Good morning.
mo Oh, yeah.
mo [m!ct]... You did a {i}really{/i} good job with the chores.
m Thanks.
mo You two ready for the big day ahead?
m Big day?
mo Today the girls have quite a few activities they'll be participating in.
mo Group activities...
mo Team building, and such.
m (Team building exercises?)
m (Hah! What is this, a corporate outing?)
mo Those activities, you and Kiara will be leading.
k What? Isn't that a job for you?
mo If these were normal therapy sessions, yes.
mo However, these activities are simpler...
mo Rooted more in developing cooperation and camaraderie among peers.
mo Don't worry, your jobs will be easy.
mo Maybe even a little fun.
m Fun?
mo Yes, but you better be on your best behavior.
mo Both of you.
m Of course. We'll be model employees.
mo You two go ahead to the girls' campground. I'll be right behind you.
n With that, Eve heads to the back door to go to her office.
n Leaving you and Kiara alone again.
k Let's go, [m!t]. We can keep talking on the way there.
m Sure.
n You both leave the house and begin walking toward the girls' campground.
    m Kiara, I wanted to talk to you about-
    k About Jane, right?
    m You did mention her before Eve came. Why?
    m Kiara, I wanted to talk to you about-
    k About Jane, right?
    m How did you know?
k Because I can imagine what you're going through. I've been there.
k I'm not much older than you, but those years I have on you taught me a lot.
m Like what?
k That not everything is meant to be.
k You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself...
k But, you two are still so fresh.
m So what? That doesn't mean I don't care about her.
k [m!ct]... It's just your hormones talking.
m What the hell?! Don't tell me how I feel!
k [m!ct], I didn't mean it like that.
m {i}Sure{/i}. I heard what you said.
k [m!ct]...
m Look, we have work to do Kiara. We can talk later.
k You're right. I shouldn't have pushed you.
n You and Kiara arrive at the girls' campground.
n There is nobody outside, but you can clearly hear the girls talking among themselves in their cabins.
n Eve arrives promptly, as she said she would.
mo Great, you're both here.
mo [m!ct], Kiara. Go get the girls and bring them outside.
n You stand there for a moment wondering which cabin to pick. 
n Cabin 1, with Naomi & Violet? 
n Or, Cabin 2? Stacy and Belle's cabin.
    n Or, Cabin 2? Stacy and Belle's cabin.
        n You approach Cabin 1, and see Naomi and Violet sitting on their beds.
        m *Knocks on door* Knock, knock!
        m Can I come in?
        nao *Giggles* Only if I get something out of it.
        m (What the hell does that mean?)
        m Okay, I'm coming in.
        m Hi, campers. It's time for your next activity.
        nao {i}Activity?{/i} I better not get dirty.
        nao But, I'm sure Violet is excited. She {i}looooves{/i} outdoor \"activities.\"
        v If you mean sports... then yes, Naomi. I do love outdoor activities.
        m Dr. Eve is waiting outside to brief all of you.
        m Let's go.
        n Naomi turns and heads for the door, as you requested.
        nao {i}\"Let's go?\"{/i} That's no way to talk to a lady of my heritage.
        nao *Whispers* I'll punish you for that, sometime.
            n Following Naomi, Violet walks toward the door.
            n There is a smirk on her face...
            n ...and a glimmer of warm affection in her eyes as she passes you.
            v You look better when you're not soaking wet.
            m Thanks, Violet. *Chuckle* I'd have to agree with you there.
            v I'm just glad you didn't die of hypothermia before you made it to the shower.
            m Did I look that cold?
            v You were shaking so much...
            v It looked like you overdosed on Red Bull.
            v Anyway, I'm glad you didn't freeze to death... 
            v Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to join me in yoga like you promised.
            n Violet turns to leave, but as she does she brushes your arm gently with her hand...
            n ...an action she makes look almost accidental.
            m (Was Violet... flirting with me?)
            m (Hmm...)
            m (Anyway, I should go back outside.)
            m (Eve and the others are waiting for me.)
            n Following Naomi, Violet walks toward the door.
            n She gives you a cold glare that pierces your soul...
            n But, she can't maintain it for long.
            v Hey, Mr. \"Two Left Feet.\" How's it going?
            v Still cold from your early-morning dip?
            m Ha-ha. Very funny, Violet.
            v Maybe it wasn't funny for you, but it was pretty funny to me.
            m I get it, I get it. I'm a dickhead. I'm sorry!
            m (When is she going to forgive me for that damn clap?! 
            m (Will she {i}ever{/i} forgive me?)
            v (Hmm... am I'm being too hard on him?)
            v (He's just an idiot sometimes... not a complete asshole.)
            v You're... not a {i}total{/i} dickhead, [m!t].
            v But, you will have to work a bit more to get back in my {i}good{/i} book.
            m What... Are you like Santa or something?
            v How'd you find out?
            m (Shit, I guess I better stop being {i}naughty{/i}.)
            m Just a guess.
            v I better go outside. 
            v Don't want to keep everyone waiting.
            m Yeah, I'll be right behind you.
        n You approach Cabin 2, and see Stacy lying on her bed, hands under her head with her eyes closed.
        m (Looks like Stacy is taking a nap. Now, where's Belle?)
        n Belle... on the other hand...
        n ...is on her bed, touching herself over her clothing.
        m (What the...)
        b Oh, [m!t]... I love it when you watch me doing this.
        m (What the fuck?!)
        b Oh... [m!t]. Why don't you just knock on our door already.
        n With that, Belle's eyes open suddenly.
        n She stops mock-touching herself and a big smile appears on her face.
        m (God damn it, she's fucking with me again!)
        m Knock-knock.
        m I really don't appreciate your \"jokes\" Belle...
        b Why, they make you {i}haaard{/i}?
        b Feeling uncomfortable with the whole situation?
        b Or... do you {i}enjoy{/i} it?
        m You know I have to abide by the guidelines, Belle.
        m And that I have someone.
        s Belle, by the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus, please leave [m!t] alone.
        b On and on and on about that bird blossom...
        b You just {i}never{/i} stop...
        b Talk like a regular person, Stacy!
        n Stacy scowls at Belle upon hearing her reaction.
        s The Heavenly Phoenix Lotus will remember your mockery.
        m Girls, please. Eve wants to see all of you outside.
        m And, Belle, be nicer to Stacy. Okay?
        b I'll try... *Giggle* But, what will you do for me in return?
        m (You'll see what I'll do...)
        m (Agh! Why am I thinking like that, again?!)
        b Thinking {i}hard{/i}? Or trying to make sure something else doesn't {i}get{/i} hard?
        n With that, Belle leaves the cabin, but not before giving your ass a gentle slap.
        b *Giggles* You better keep thinking about that.
        m HEY!
        b Oh, and you look good showering.
        m (Huh? Could Belle have--)
        m (Nah, that's impossible.)
        s Please forgive Belle for her actions, [m!t].
        s She is still a conflicted being.
        s Were she more willing... the heavenly flames would guide her.
        m Maybe one day she'll reconsider your offer.
        s *Whispers* Maybe one day {i}you'll{/i} reconsider.
        n Stacy gives you a small kiss on the cheek...
        n ..before turning and swiftly exiting the cabin.
        n You freeze for a moment, taken aback by the quick kiss.
        n You regain your composure and head outside to meet Eve and the others.
n You leave the cabin you were just in and regroup with Eve, Kiara and the girls.
mo Good morning, girls.
mo Today is a big day, with many activities ahead of you.
b Oooh... I {i}love{/i} activities.
mo *Ahem* The first of which is synchronized swimming exercises.
s *Whispers* Why must it be something so {i}cold{/i}...
mo After that, you'll all need to change into something more athletic...
nao Athletic?
nao I'm {i}not{/i} going to do anything that will make me sweaty and gross.
nao I draw the line at volleyball. That's fun, at least.
mo You don't have to participate.
mo But, it will be detrimental to the healing process.
nao I don't care. I'll take the \"L,\" there.
mo Please. No more interruptions, ladies. We shouldn't delay things any further.
mo Once you change into athletic clothes, you'll go to the volleyball field.
mo You'll be playing Red Rover.
mo It's a great game to improve teamwork.
mo Later, once the sun has set, we'll have another campfire session.
mo Until then, Kiara and [m!t] will be your supervisors.
mo [m!ct], you'll be the lifeguard during the swimming exercise... 
mo So I expect you to be ready on the dock.
m (Lifeguard?)
m (So I have to stand around roasting in the sun...)
m (While they all get to chill in the water?)
m *Grumble* Sounds good.
mo Good. Kiara, you'll be leading the ladies in their exercise.
k Sure thing, Eve.
mo Please be as cooperative as possible, everyone.
mo These activities aren't meant to be punishing.
mo They're to help you all get along better...
mo And, to bring down your barriers.
m (Bring down their barriers?)
m (The thought of the girls free to do whatever they want horrifies me...)
n And, turns you on...
mo So, go get changed everyone. Meet back on the dock as soon as possible.
n With that, the girls disperse back into their cabins.
n You give them all a good look as they do.
n Belle and Stacy are obviously walking flirtatiously.
n While Naomi and Violet return to their cabins more casually.
n You see Eve and Kiara walk back toward the house, and follow suit.
n You get back to the house a bit behind Eve and Kiara.
n You enter the house and close the door behind you.
n You look around the living room, but see nobody around...
n Before heading upstairs to your room.
m (They really got some distance on me.)
m (Maybe I do need to work out more regularly...)
n You go to your room and change into your swim shorts.
n Back in the hallway, you go downstairs and exit the house.
m (I needed to meet the girls at the dock...)
m (But, I changed a bit too quickly.)
m (I {i}could{/i} just wait for them at the dock...)
m (Or, I could take a short walk around the camp...)
n After making your way to the girls' campground...
n ...you are curious to see what they're up to.
m (I should see what the girls are up to...)
m (Make sure they're not lollygagging.)
n You make your way around to the side of Naomi and Violet's cabin.
n As you peek through the open side window... 
n Being as discreet as possible...
n ...you see Violet leaving the cabin.
m (Huh, I wonder where Violet's going...)
m (Damn, she looks great in that swimsuit!)
m (Focus, [m!t].)
n After Violet leaves, your attention is drawn toward Naomi's side of the room.
m (And... Naomi? Fooling around?)
m (WOAH! Uhhh... I didn't expect such a great surprise.)
n Naomi unexpectedly turns around and spots you watching her change.
nao [m!ct], what the hell! Spying on me once wasn't enough?!
m Naomi, it isn't what it looks like!
nao You better climb your ass through that window and explain yourself!
n Still awe-struck by what you saw...
n ...it takes you a moment to collect yourself before climbing through the window.
nao There, that's good. Now that you're in here...
nao Sit. Down.
m *Gulp* (Naomi really knows how to be dominant.)
nao Good. So, what were you doing spying on me?
nao You liked what you saw so much you decided to do it again?
nao You wanted a free show from such a fine lady?
nao *Quietly* I bet you wish your girlfriend was hot like me...
nao Well... {i}You know what?{/i}
nao I think you're indebted to me...
nao Especially for spying on me changing, just now.
nao And, for your general insolence.
m What do you mean?
nao You know what I mean.
nao So. What do I want?
nao Hmm... something juicy.
m (What the hell does she mean by juicy?)
m Uh... Sure. I do owe it to you, I guess.
nao Wow, no resistance? Good.
        n Did you report Naomi's phone
    nao I've got an idea...
    nao Come over here.
    n Without much resistance you take a few steps toward Naomi.
    n Until you're standing close together.
    m This good?
    nao Yes. This'll do.
    nao Now, wait just a second.
    m What?
    nao Come here.
    n As you reluctantly begin to come closer to her...
    n Naomi pulls you by the arm to the bed.
    n On top of her.
    m (What the fuck?! Why is she being so forceful?)
    nao Good.
    nao Now, I want you to get a good...
    nao {i}Hard{/i}... look... at what's in front of you.
    m *Gulp* And then what...
    nao Nothing, yet. Just look.
    m (Oh god. Why is she torturing me in such a weird way?)
    m (Does she get turned on by this?)
    n Having your head forced down by Naomi...
    n Staring at her sexy bikini bottom...
    n ...and knowing the whole time what's underneath, waiting... turns you on.
    m (What the fuck?!)
    m (I'm getting a boner from a situation like {i}this?{/i})
    m (Hmm... It is pretty kinky...)
    nao What's this?
    nao Is this making you excited?
    nao (I think he's waited long enough.)
    nao Well, good. You've been patient.
    n With that being said, Naomi takes her bikini bottom off...
    n Revealing her perfect pussy.
    n She grabs you by the hair and pulls your face to her wet pussy.
    nao You waited, now {i}have me{/i}.
    n You instinctually begin licking her pussy.
    n The thrill of this passionate moment pushes everything else out of your mind.
    nao Oh my god, [m!t]!
    nao Keep going...
    m (What am I thinking?!)
    nao Right there.
    m (Why can't I stop?!)
    m (Have these girls driven me crazy?)
    nao *Moans* Stay... focused, [m!t].
    nao Eat my pussy... more.
    n Hearing her say such lewd things drives you wild.
    n You start getting more into it and...
    nao AAAaaaahh!
    n Naomi pushes you away from her, stopping the orgasm.
    nao (Shit, he almost made me... cum.)
    nao (He's far better than I expected...)
    nao I think I used you enough...
    nao I'd say we're even now.
    m Good...
    m (What just happened? How did I lose control like that?)
    m I should... uhh...
    m I have to go wait at the dock.
    nao Ciao, [m!t].
    nao Oh, one more thing...
    nao If you want more... I need to have you all to myself.
    n Naomi blows you a kiss before putting her bikini bottom back on.
    m Bye.
    m (I need to get to the dock and act casual.)
    m (Maybe even throw some water on my face to regain composure.)
    nao I've got an idea...
    n Naomi lustily puts a finger to her lip.
    n Stand up for me, [m!t].
    m Sure, Naomi.
    m (She has a strange look in her eyes... What's she planning?)
    nao Take off your shirt, and shorts.
    m I can take off my shirt, but my shorts stay on.
    nao You don't get to decide, peasant.
    m (What the fuck did she just call me?!)
    nao The shorts come off too. Quickly now.
    n Reluctantly, you take your swim shorts off. 
    n Naomi's eyes immediately begin scanning your body.
    nao Good. Now, hold still.
    m (What?)
    n Suddenly, Naomi grabs the phone sitting on her bed.
    m (Ah fuck, why did I let her keep that?!)
    nao Say cheese!
    nao Now I've got something valuable from you.
    nao That seems like fair compensation for before.
    m Fair?! {i}Yeah right{/i}.
    nao You're right... I'm not being fair.
    nao But... there's something else I want.
    nao You may even like it.
    m If you're talking about fucking me...
    nao You think I'd let you fuck me right here, right now?
    m Oh shit, you're right. Violet could be back any minute!
    nao Don't worry. I know the beast well.
    nao She went to take her usual post-yoga shower...
    nao Which was delayed by Eve's announcement.
    m Naomi, ease up on Violet. Please.
    nao Maybe I will, if you do what I ask.
    nao No witty remark? Good.
    nao Touch me.
    m *Chokes* What?!
    n To your surprise, Naomi grabs your hands and presses them on her body.
    n Your right hand on her pussy, and your left on her tits.
    m Hey...
    nao Sssh! Just keep doing this.
    n She grabs your hands harder... 
    n ...squeezing and touching herself more firmly with your hands.
    m (What is it about these girls?!)
    m (Does being away from society really unleash our primal urges?!)
    n You're unable to concentrate on contemplating that question further.
    n As you're too aroused from the sight and feeling of what you're doing.
    nao *Moans* Oh, [m!t]. Your cock is so hard.
    n Her hand is drawn toward the huge cock twitching in front of her.
    nao Touch me more.
    n She takes off her swimsuit and brings your hands back to their positions.
    n Now, your hands are touching her bare skin...
    m (She's driving me crazy! I can't think straight...)
    nao If you don't, I might feel like sharing that picture with everyone.
    m (What?!)
    nao *Giggles* Maybe Violet and I could bond over that?
    m (You're trying to blackmail me? I'll show you...)
    n To Naomi's surprise...
    n The two fingers previously playing with her clit are thrust inside of her.
    nao *Gasp* [m!t]!
    nao WHAT THE FUCK!?
    n Naomi slaps you across the face for that unwanted surprise.
    n Dazed from the slap, Naomi pulls your fingers out of her pussy.
    nao You think you get to decide how this goes?!
    m (Wha...)
    nao Oh, {i}no, no, no...{/i}
    nao If you want to go {i}that{/i} far, you'll need to be all mine.
    m (Okay, that was a big mistake...)
    nao I'm not the kind of girl who likes to share her toys...
    nao Do you understand?
    m Mhm. (Oh, I understand.)
    n Angry that Naomi slapped you...
    n A cruel thought of revenge comes into your mind.
    m (She fucking slapped me! The least I can do is tease her nipples...)
    m (To get back at her.)
        m (To get back at her.)
            m (Take this!)
            nao *Gasp* AAAHH!
            n Naomi trembles in the tidal waves of orgasm crashing over her.
            n She nearly falls to her knees as her legs give way.
            nao What's your fucking problem, peasant!?
            m That's for acting pretentious, and slapping me.
            nao You asshole!
            nao Now I'll definitely show this picture to everyone.
            nao Just you wait!
            m (Ah shit...)
            m (What can of worms did I open now?)
            nao Get out!
            n You get out of the cabin as quickly as you can.
            n Without attracting attention to yourself, of course.
            m (I should go to the dock and act casual.)
            m (Like I've been there the whole time.)
            m (Nah. That's a {i}TERRIBLE{/i} idea.)
            n You decide against pinching her nipple.
            nao Okay... I think we're even, now.
            nao You should get out of here. The \"activities\" will start soon.
            m You're right. I need to go wait at the dock.
            m You better keep your end of the bargain.
            nao I intend to.
            nao Ciao, [m!t].
            m Arrivederci.
            m (I can't believe this just happened...)
            m (Act casual, [m!t]. To the dock.)
n After making your way to the girls' campground...
n ...you are curious to see what they're up to.
m (I should see what the girls are up to...)
m (Make sure they're not lollygagging.)
n You make your way over to the side of Stacy and Belle's cabin.
n As you peek through the window as cautiously as possible...
n Trying to be as stealthy as you can...
m (I really need to improve my sneak skill...)
m (My past \"attempts\" have been awful.)
n You peek your head just high enough above the window-sill to see inside.
m Hmm...
n Your eyes scan the room.
n You're surprised to see Stacy and Belle in the act of changing.
m (Oh shit, I had no clue they'd be changing!)
m (But, it's such a nice view...)
m (I just hope Belle's Spidey Sense isn't tingling right now.)
m (She has been strangely good at catching me spying...)
n You continue to look through the window.
n Watching the girls try on various swimsuits.
m (Why are they taking so long? Just choose one already.)
n Finally, they appear to have chosen the swimsuits for the activity.
m (I think they're done changing, I should get out of here.)
n As you sneak away, there is a creeping fear in your mind...
n That Belle knew you were watching them.
m (I'm sure Belle didn't see me...)
m (But, still... it's hard to shake the feeling that she did.)
m (Better get to the dock and wait for the girls.)
n You arrive at the dock and wait for the girls to show up.
n You look across the lake and, for a moment, are in a zen state.
m This camp can actually be really peaceful...
m ...despite the guests.
n Your moment of peace is interrupted by Kiara, leading the girls to the dock.
k Talking to yourself?
k Maybe you'll be Eve's next patient.
m Ha-ha. Good joke Kiara.
m I'm just enjoying the view.
b I think an even better view is right behind you, [m!t].
m {i}Hey girls.{/i}
n Kiara stops the group in front of [m!t].
n She turns around to face the girls.
k Ladies, today we'll be doing some simple synchronized swimming routines.
k Nothing too complicated.
k Dr. Eve wanted to make sure you don't go too far out of your comfort zones.
s I don't particularly enjoy swimming at all...
s Especially not when the water's so cold.
k I'm sorry to hear that, Stacy, but you'll need to participate.
k You all need to work together, in harmony, to make this a breeze.
m (That'll be a miracle if it happens.)
k [m!ct], you'll stand watch on the dock as a lifeguard.
k Make sure all the girls are safe, and if something goes wrong...
m Jump in to save the day. Got it.
k Exactly. Easy enough, right?
m Yep.
b {i}My hero!{/i}
k Belle, quit it.
k Ladies... Time to get in the lake.
n Like the sirens of legends, the girls gracefully jump into the lake.
s Heavenly flame, this water is ice cold!
v I think it's pretty refreshing.
b {i}So{/i} refreshing.
b [m!ct] is really missing out, standing in the hot sun.
nao Poor thing.
m Kiara, you're not getting in?
k Oh, you're right!
k Silly me, I forgot.
k (Or... maybe I wanted to make sure your eyes stay on me.)
n Standing beside you, as the last of the ladies to get in the water...
n Kiara wraps herself with a towel and changes.
k Just a second!
n She changes in record time, and drops the towel abruptly.
m (Gulp.)
n Giving you a mini-heart attack, before you notice she's in her swimwear.
n She lowers herself off the dock quickly, and joins the girls.
k Come on, girls. Follow me.
n They all swim toward the middle of the lake and begin their exercise.
n At first, you're completely confused by what they're doing.
m (What are they doing?)
n After a bit of a \"warm up\" they begin to swim more gracefully...
n And, after some more time, they become synchronized.
m (Wow, they're actually getting it.)
m Great job, girls!
n The girls don't pay attention to your comment.
n Instead, they continue to follow Kiara's lead.
n Until...
b HELP!! HEEELP!!!!
k [m!ct], help her!
m (Oh shit! Belle's drowning!)
n You swiftly take off your shirt and dive into the lake.
n It only takes a few seconds for you to swim to Belle.
b HELP! [m!t]!
n Belle grabs you, and you struggle to keep your head above the water.
n Remembering a lifesaving course you took last summer...
n ...your body and mind spring to action and assume a lifeguard hold on Belle.
m Come on, Belle! You're gonna make it!
n You manage to get her to the far shore of the lake, quickly.
m Come on, Belle! Don't give up on me!
n Remembering bits and pieces of your CPR training from years back...
n You check Belle's pulse by touching her neck.
m (Shit! I'm so panicked I can't get a good read on her pulse.)
n Next, you check her breathing...
n ...but don't feel any air coming out of her mouth.
m I don't think she's breathing! I have to do CPR!
n The other girls are making their way across the lake as you give Belle mouth-to-mouth.
m Come on! Come on!
n As you're giving Belle the life saving kiss...
b *Whispers* Kiss me again, [m!t].
m What? Belle!
n Belle steals another kiss from you before dropping back to the ground.
b *Giggling* This was SUCH a great prank!
b I even got a little something extra out of it.
n As Belle \"comes to,\" Kiara and the girls make it to shore.
k Belle! Are you okay?
b I am now. [m!t]'s my heeeero.
k What happened?
m She decided to play a sick prank on me!
k What?!
m Yeah.
m She thought it would be funny to fake drowning...
m So she could trick me into kissing her.
b That's not true. I didn't make you do CPR on me...
b You're just not that good at realizing when someone's messing with you.
k Okay. Session's over, ladies!
k Belle, you better not pull a stunt like this again.
k Do you hear me?
b I hear you loud and... Mostly loud, actually.
k Good...
k (Bitch...)
m (What the hell is wrong with her? I was freaking out!)
k We're done swimming for today.
k Go back to your cabins and get changed into something more athletic.
nao Athletic? I refuse.
k Why? Physical activities are important...
v To maintain a healthy body.
k Exactly what Violet said.
nao Look, I just don't {i}do{/i} activities like that.
nao I can't afford to damage my skin.
k Fine, Naomi. But you need to be there.
k Meet back at the volleyball field.
n Listening to Kiara, the girls start walking to their cabins.
k *Whispers* Belle really is a loony bitch...
m *Chuckles* She's too much...
k I agree.
k And, she shouldn't mess with you... like that.
m (Is Kiara jealous?)
m Look, you're right. It was just a stupid prank...
m Let's head back to the house, Kiara.
n You and Kiara walk back to the house together.
n After making it to the second story landing, Kiara goes to her room and you go to yours.
n Once inside your room, you change into your athletic clothing.
n As you sit there, you look out the window in contemplation.
m (The ride never ends on the crazy train...)
m (I'm just glad to have this moment to collect my thoughts in peace.)
    m (I mean, what happened with Naomi was insane...)
    m (I can't believe I let myself get so carried away...)
    m (But I secretly... enjoyed it?)
    m (Why am I doing? I have a smoking-hot babe waiting for me...)
    m (But the distance ended up being a big issue.)
    n Your gaze eventually drifts from the window...
    n Toward your phone sitting beside you on the bed.
    m (I wonder if Jane sent me any messages.)
    m (I mean... I spied on Stacy and Belle!)
    m (I just wanted to see if they were wasting time...)
    m (And ended up in a situation where I'm a perv.)
    m (But I'm sure they didn't see me. Even with Belle's unnatural perception.)
    m (Why did I keep looking, though...)
    m (I have a smoking-hot babe waiting for me...)
    m (But the distance ended up being a bigger issue than I thought it'd be.)
    n Your gaze eventually drifts from the window...
    n Toward your phone sitting beside you on the bed.
    m (I wonder if Jane sent me any messages.)
    m (Well, the lake was pretty peaceful.)
    m (And it only got better once the girls showed up.)
    m (Everybody in their perfectly-fitted bikinis...)
    m (God damn, they were lookin' hot!)
    m (Almost {i}too{/i} hot.)
    m (Fuck... Why am I fantasizing about them like that?)
    m (I have a smoking-hot babe waiting for me...)
    m (But the distance ended up being a big issue.)
    n Your gaze eventually drifts from the window...
    n Toward your phone sitting beside you on the bed.
    m (I wonder if Jane sent me any messages.)
n You pick up your phone and unlock it.
n On the home screen you see that you have some new messages from Jane.
j Hey [m!t]. Sorry I missed your call, and messages.
j I've been doing a lot of thinking...
j Can we talk? Now?
n You sit there wondering why her tone has changed so much.
m Something's up with Jane...
m I better call her.
n You call Jane.
m (Still not picking up... I wonder what she's doing.)
m (Is she letting it ring on purpose?)
n Alone with your thoughts, the dial tone being your only company...
n You become more and more anxious.
m (Oh god... what if she figured it out?)
m (She isn't stupid...)
m (Oh shit...)
n The phone rings for a little while longer, before she picks up.
j Hi, [m!t]. How are you?
m I'm good, babe.
m You sure made me wait... What's wrong?
j You know what's wrong...
m I really don't.
j I know you can feel it...
j The distance.
m Yeah... I do miss you.
j And I miss you too. It's just...
j ...too much.
m What?
j It's too hard to keep doing this.
m Is...
m Is there someone else?
j No... No.
j Of course not. But, I just... don't know.
m You want to take a break...
m Because of the distance?
j Yes. Maybe... I don't know...
j I also have this feeling...
m (Oh shit, she does know!)
m Go on?
j That I'm holding you back.
j The last time we talked about the patients, you had this...
j ...excitement in your voice.
m Jane... No... I...
n Not sure whether or not you should tell Jane the truth, you pause for a moment.
m (Should I tell her what's been going on?)
m (I don't know. I don't want to hurt her any more.)
m (But, she also deserves the truth...)
    m (But, she also deserves the truth...)
        n You decide to tell Jane the truth about what's been happening at Red Falls.
        m Well...
        m Okay.
        j {i}What?{/i}
        m I have something to tell you.
        j Oh no...
        m The girls... The patients, here...
        m They're crazy!
        j That's no way to talk about them.
        m I mean it. Almost all of them are constantly trying to...
        j Fuck you?
        j Oh no...
        j You didn't...
        j Did you?
        m I didn't! I swear...
        j That pause sounds like it'll be followed by a \"but.\"
        m But... I have been close with some of them.
        j {i}How could you?!{/i}
        m They forced themselves on me, in some cases using blackmail...
        j Sure.
        m I swear! That's the truth...
        j Look... For my own sake...
        j I'll believe you.
        j Because believing you'd willingly do something like this to me...
        j It just hurts too much.
        m Jane...
        j You know...
        j I guess I can sympathize with those... {i}girls{/i}... in some weird way.
        j I couldn't resist you, after all.
        m Jane... please.
        m I was trying my best to keep them away.
        m I'm so sorry.
        j Don't be.
        j But... this just proves one thing.
        j The distance is too much.
        j Things... keep getting in between us.
        j It's breaking my heart a little more every day.
        m Jane...
        j No, [m!t]... It's okay, really.
        m What?
        j I don't want our feelings to hurt us...
        j I think we just need some time alone.
        m (Time alone? Is it really over?)
        m I care about you... so much, Jane.
        j And I care about you.
        j Maybe, if you still care after the summer... we can decide what to do.
        j *Sigh* Or, maybe we'll realize this is a huge mistake.
        m I wouldn't be against that.
        j Good. Then... I guess that's it, for now.
        m Yeah... I guess it is.
        j Thanks... Thanks for being honest with me.
        j I have to go now... Bye, [m!t].
        n Jane makes a kiss noise through the phone and hangs up.
        n You can almost hear the tears falling down her cheek, as she hangs up.
        m Well... that's it, I guess.
        m (This was way harder than I expected. Fuck...)
        n You lie back on the bed, looking up at the ceiling.
        m (Maybe it's time to live in the moment...)
        m (Oh shit! I need to meet back at the volleyball field.)
        n You decide to spare Jane the truth, as it would only hurt her.
        m I just think this is hard for both of us...
        m And I sounded excited because I was talking to you.
        j You say that... But I don't hear that same excitement now.
        m The distance is hard...
        j It is...
        j But that's not it.
        j I can tell you're not being truthful with me.
        m (Oh fuck...)
        j You push me aside...
        j ...and then think I'm so stupid I can't tell when you're lying to me?
        m No, Jane... I swear...
        j I think we've both drifted away from each other...
        j And, not just because of the distance.
        m I should have told you everything that was happening.
        j It's too late for that now...
        m (SHIT!)
        j I think we should spend some time apart.
        m What?
        j I don't want our love to hurt us...
        j I think we just need some time alone.
        m (Time alone? Is it really over?)
        j Especially after this.
        m I care about you... so much, Jane.
        j And I care about you.
        j But... this clearly isn't working right now.
        j Maybe, if you still care after the summer... we can decide what to do.
        j *Sigh* Or, maybe I'll realize this is a {i}huge{/i} mistake.
        m I wouldn't be against that.
        j Good. Then... I guess that's it, for now.
        m Yeah... I guess it is.
        j I have to go now... Bye, [m!t].
        n Jane makes a kiss noise through the phone and hangs up.
        n You can almost hear the tears falling down her cheek, as she hangs up.
        m Well... that's it, I guess.
        m (This was way harder than I expected. Fuck...)
        n You lie back on the bed, looking up at the ceiling.
        m (Maybe it's time to live in the moment...)
        m (Oh shit! I need to meet back at the volleyball field.)
n You exit your room onto the second story landing.
n At the top of the stairs...
n You hear Emily and Eve discussing something downstairs.
m (I wonder what they're talking about?)
m (Should I eavesdrop to hear more?)
    m (Should I eavesdrop to hear more?)
        n You decide to eavesdrop on their conversation.
        m (They really are doing their best to be secretive...)
        m (But why?)
        n You make your way down the first two steps to hear them more clearly.
        em I don't know how to feel about it.
        mo Don't rush your feelings. They will come.
        em I hope so. It's really confusing me.
        n Emily feels like she's being watched, and takes a look around.
        em Hmm... Sorry. I thought I heard something.
        m (How does she know I'm here? I'm being perfectly stealthy!)
        mo I didn't hear anything.
        em What do you think I should do?
        mo Well, you could wait and see if your feelings go away or...
        mo ...you could tell him.
        mo Then you'll know for sure.
        mo Maybe it's mutual.
        em I doubt it. He doesn't seem to notice me.
        mo You could make him notice you...
        em Hmm... I'll try and see how it goes.
        n You're really intrigued by this guy Emily is talking about.
        m (I wonder who he is...)
        m Does she mean... me?
        n Emily and Eve's talk leaves you confused...
        n ...so you intend to find out more.
        n You decide to go downstairs as casually as you can.
        m Hi, Eve. Hey, Emily.
        em Jesus! You startled me.
        em How long have you been standing there?
        m Not that long. I just finished my shower.
        n It seems Emily has bought your white lie.
        em Well, okay. Do you know where you need to be?
        m Yep, the volleyball field.
        m I'll be off, then. See you later!
        n You decide against eavesdropping on their clearly private conversation.
        m (I already overstep my bounds with the \"etiquette issues\"...)
        m (Better just head downstairs.)
        n You continue downstairs, cutting Eve and Emily's conversation short.
        mo *Unintelligible* Oh. Hello, [m!t].
        m Hi, Eve. Hey, Emily.
        em Jesus! You startled me.
        em How long have you been standing there?
        m Oh, I finished my shower and came downstairs just now.
        n It seems Emily has bought your white lie.
        em Well, okay then. Shouldn't you be somewhere else?
        m Yep, Red Rover at the volleyball field.
        em Chop chop then!
        m Bye, Emily. Eve.
        mo See you later, [m!t].
n You finish speaking to Emily and Eve, open the front door and leave the house.
em You don't think he was listening to our conversation...
mo No. [m!t] would never do that.
n You finally arrive at the volleyball field.
n To your surprise, everybody is already there.
n Waiting for you.
m (Damn, they really chose the right outfits for today.)
m (Oh crap, I wonder how long they've been waiting.)
m Sorry to keep everybody waiting!
k [m!ct], you're finally here.
m Hi, girls.
n The girls are ogling you far more than you were ogling them, a moment ago.
m So, let's get to it. Kiara, what do we do?
k I could have sworn you've played Red Rover as a kid, [m!t].
m Oh, I have. I just wanted to let you lead.
m Some of the girls might not know how to play.
k Oh. That's very thoughtful of you, [m!t].
k SO! Ladies!
k First, form a line side-by-side, and hold each others' hands.
k You too, [m!t].
n You end up standing in between Stacy and Violet, holding their hands.
v I approve of this lineup.
s As do I. Let us share our warmth.
k Okay, now that you're all lined up...
k Wait a second...
k Naomi, you're really not going to join us?
nao No way! You heard what I said before.
nao My skin is too delicate to play in the dirt.
k Okay. {i}Fine.{/i}
k We'll continue without Naomi.
nao I'll get more out of this by watching, anyway.
k Next, we'll need a runner.
k To start...
k I'll show you how it's done.
k Ladies, and [m!t], hold on tight!
k Here I come!
n Kiara tries to break through, but fails.
k Great job, defenders!
k I wasn't giving it my all since that was mostly for demonstration.
m Sure, sure.
k [m!ct]! Stop teasing me.
m Sorry.
k Now that you've seen what you'll be doing, I'll join the line.
k The next runner is...
k Belle!
b Me first? Okay!
b Here I come! Catch me, [m!t]!
m (What? She's going straight for me?!)
n Belle vaulted over your defenses without too much effort.
b Made it! Try to beat that!
k Great job, Belle. Next is Stacy!
s May the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus lend me strength!
n Stacy rushes forward abruptly, with fire in her eyes.
n But, as she runs into the human wall, she is ensnared.
b Looks like your flame fizzled out, Stacy.
s Why must you say such things?
k Good attempt, Stacy. You'll get it next time.
k Violet, you're up!
v I feel like this is a bit unfair...
k Don't worry about that. We'll do our best to stop you.
v Okay...
v Then, here goes nothing!
n You see Violet lock eyes with you.
n It's clear to you that she's taking it easy on the other girls... 
n Singling you out as fair game.
m (Oh shit, she's sprinting straight towards me!)
n A millisecond after that thought came to mind...
n The powerful force of Violet's sprint impacts you.
m AAGHK!
v (Oh no!)
n As Violet tackles you, your lips nearly touch.
v (Oh my God! What just happened?!)
    v (I wish...)
    v (I wish it did.)
    n Violet lies there for a moment, on top of you, before she realizes.
    v [m!ct], are you okay?
    v (Oh my god, did I kill him?)
    m (Am I dead?)
    m Are you... an angel?
    v (He's cute even when he's concussed...)
    v [m!ct]! Can you hear me?
    m You don't need to yell...
    m I can hear you.
    m I'm fine. Just a little shaken.
    v I'm so sorry... I didn't mean to hit you so hard.
    m I know you didn't. It's okay, Violet.
    m (I know you can't control your strength.)
    m *Chuckle* Just... take it easy on me next time.
    v I'll make sure to be more gentle with you.
    k [m!ct], you took quite a hit.
    v Again, sorry!
    k It's okay, Violet. It was an accident.
    k But, I think that'll be it for today's activities.
    k The sun is going to set pretty soon.
    k You can all change back into something more casual for the campfire tonight.
    k You all have some time to kill before that begins.
    n Dismissed by Kiara, the girls head back to their campground.
    m And us?
    k Eve wanted us to meet her back at the house.
    m Lead the way.
    v (We almost kissed!?)
    v (I'd never want to kiss that douchebag...)
    v (Oh, but I'm crushing him...)
    m (Am I dying?)
    v (I should let him up...)
    v (I'll just leave him there a little longer.)
    n Violet eventually gets off of you, allowing you to breathe easier.
    m *Gasp* Oh... my god.
    m Why... did you...
    v It was an accident, really.
    v (But I did enjoy seeing you like that, a bit.)
    v I'm really sorry.
    m I know...
    m (Did she do that on purpose?)
    m It's fine. I'll live...
    m (But it'll take me a while to recover.)
    v Good. I don't know what I'd do if you died.
    v (I actually could have hurt him...)
    v (I can't keep holding a grudge against him...)
    v (Something terrible could happen to him if I do.)
    k [m!ct], are you okay?!
    k Violet took you down pretty hard...
    m I'm fine, really.
    m No need to worry, Kiara.
    m And... don't feel guilty. Violet. I know it was an accident.
    v (He's being too kind...)
    v (Now I feel even worse.)
    v Thanks... [m!t].
    v I'll make sure to be more gentle with you.
    k I think that'll be it for today's activities.
    k The sun is going to set pretty soon.
    k You can all change back into something more casual for the campfire tonight.
    k You all have some time to kill before that begins.
    n Dismissed by Kiara, the girls head back to their campground.
    m And us?
    k Eve wanted us to meet her back at the house.
    m Lead the way.
n You and Kiara talk as you walk back to the house.
k So, how is everything, besides the broken bones?
m *Chuckle* I'm okay. Nothing broken.
m You know, you were right about earlier.
k What do you mean?
m When you told me that my relationship with Jane was a summer fling...
k [m!ct]... What happened?
m Jane and I are taking a break.
k (\"Taking a break.\" If I had a dollar for every time I heard that...)
k I'm sorry to hear that...
m No, it's for the best.
m With everything happening here...
m And, the distance...
m It just wasn't meant to be. For now.
k I hope what I said didn't cause this...
m It didn't, Kiara. There was a rift forming between Jane and I.
k (I'm sad to hear this from [m!t].)
k (But, a part of me is...)
k I understand.
m (Kiara's being so empathetic. She really wants me to be happy, huh?)
k Well...
k Now that you're a free man... What are you going to do?
m I don't know. I guess... \"the world's my oyster,\" now.
m (I haven't really thought about that, actually...)
k That's a good approach. Don't go too crazy, though.
k (Unless it's with me.)
m I won't. I'm sure Eve will keep me eternally busy from now on, anyway.
k Maybe you'll get lucky and she'll ease up on you.
m The Guidelines won't, though.
k (Is he really thinking that much about the girls?)
k Well... My last piece of advice to you is this.
k What Eve doesn't know won't hurt her.
m (Is Kiara really giving me advice on how to hook up with the girls?!)
k Just... don't forget about me.
m How could I?
m (For this I'll never forget you, Kiara.)
n You and Kiara make it back to the house.
n Kiara sits on the couch and you go upstairs to take another shower.
m (I should take another shower.)
m (Hopefully tomorrow we won't be doing activities that make me so sweaty.)
m (The summer is really heating up...)
n You quickly grab a change of clothes from your room.
n You approach the bathroom door, and hear someone is inside.
m (Oh, I guess the bathroom is occupied.)
n As you stand there waiting...
n You hear a quiet moaning coming from the other side of the door.
m (Is someone... Masturbating?)
m (Emily? No, the voice sounds too mature.)
m (Then it must be...)
m *Gulp* (Eve?)
n As you stand there listening to Eve moan...
n You begin to feel the blood rushing to your cock.
m (Ah shit, why is this making me horny?)
m (Better interrupt her so I can take a shower and end this awkward moment.)
m (Should I knock before I enter... or not?)
    m (Should I knock before I enter... or not?)
        n You decide to be a decent human being and knock.
        mo Who is it? I'm almost done!
        n You hear her rinse off a bit more, before she turns off the shower.
        n You hear the shower door open and close, and then footsteps leading to the door.
        m It's just me. I wanted to take a shower.
        mo Oh. Hello, [m!t].
        m Hey, Eve. Sorry to cut your shower short.
        mo It's fine. I was just finishing up anyway.
        m (Finishing up? It sure did sound like that.)
        mo I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
        m It's okay. I wasn't waiting that long.
        mo (Hopefully he didn't hear me.)
        mo Good. Well, I'll leave you to it, [m!t].
        m Thanks, Eve. See you later.
        mo See you later, [m!t].
        n As usual, you try to enter the bathroom without remembering to knock.
        n To your surprise, the door is locked.
        m (Oh, it's locked.)
        n Whoever is inside made a smart choice in locking the door.
        mo [m!ct]! Is that you?!
        n You hear the shower stop and Eve stomp across the bathroom to the door.
        mo What did I say about not knocking!
        m I'm sorry, Eve! It slipped my mind.
        mo As it always does.
        mo (He really needs to learn some manners!)
        m I just wanted to take a shower.
        mo So you tried to barge in on mine?
        m I... Uhh... Yes.
        mo Quite rude, [m!t].
        m Sorry about that.
        mo Well, since you already interrupted my shower, I guess you can have it.
        mo I was just about finished, anyway.
        m (It {i}did{/i} sound like that...)
        m Thanks, Eve. See you later.
        mo Goodbye, [m!t]. Knock from now on.
n You finish talking to Eve and enter the bathroom.
n Closing the door behind you, and locking it, before you shower.
m *Chuckle* (Don't want anyone barging in... like I tend to do.)
n As you shower...
n You reminisce about everything that has happened the past few days.
n How Naomi's tit fell out... perfectly into your mouth.
n How you watched Belle get pleasured by Stacy...
    n You remember Stacy...
    n How she begged for your help...
    n Begged for release.
    n How she guided your hands across her body. Using them to help herself.
    n You remember the intense heat her body gave off...
    n ...and how it felt pressed against you.
    n Most of all...
    n You remember the cry of pleasure you silenced with your hand...
    n ...and her body's intense reaction to that.
    n You remember Violet...
    n Specifically, the moment you shared with her in the shower.
    n Her alluring gaze pops into your mind.
    n The way she looked at your cock... hungrily.
    n You become more tense, as you recall the situation.
    n How you could only look... not touch.
    n A part of you wished you could have just taken her right there...
    n But the fact you couldn't only made the moment more intense.
    m (Violet...)
    m (When will you open up to me, fully?)
    n You remember Naomi...
    n And her dominance.
        n So dominant... she made you get on your knees.
        n How close her pussy was to your face, yet so far.
        n How much you wanted to lean forward and begin licking it.
        n You become more wound up by the thoughts...
        n She made you wait, and stare at it.
        n It made you go crazy on the inside...
        n You remember how she grabbed your head and let you come close.
        n How you ate her pussy like a wild animal tasting a fine steak for the first time.
        n These thoughts cause that feeling to well back up. Driving you mad.
        n How she blackmailed you.
        n You wish you hadn't let her keep her phone.
        n Despite a part of you knowing without it, what happened earlier wouldn't have happened.
        m (I'm glad I let Naomi keep her phone. Even with the blackmail.)
        n Your memories refocus on touching her body.
        n First, more gently, but increasingly strong.
        n Her warm, wet pussy on your hand dominates the memory.
        n You remember her moans...
        n The noises she made.
        n It makes you go a bit crazy.
        n Especially remembering the noises she made when she climaxed.
n You suddenly realize you've been stroking your cock intensely...
n For a while.
n You continue, while reminiscing on the sexiest encounters you've had at Red Falls...
n Before another memory comes into your mind.
m (Oh shit! I never did get my answer for that encounter...)
n The memory makes you stop stroking, and your cock goes soft.
m (Why'd that have to pop into my mind now?!)
m (I was so close...)
m (Whatever. I need to finish up already.)
n You finish your shower and get changed.
n Not knowing what your next task will be, you decide to go downstairs.
n As you make your way downstairs... 
n You see Eve and Emily sitting on the couch.
mo There you are.
em Hey, [m!t]!
m Hi Eve. Hey Emily.
m (I'll never get a chance to confront her.)
mo I know it may feel like you never rest...
mo But I have another task for you.
m *Grumbles* Oh yeah?
mo I swear it's the last one for today.
mo You've done a great job today.
mo I really do have to hand it to you.
m Well, thanks Eve.
mo Anyway, I need you to go collect kindling and start the fire.
mo The sun is setting, so you don't have much light left.
m So, I better be quick?
mo If you don't want to work in the dark.
mo I hear you're... prone to clumsiness.
m (Was that a joke?)
m Maybe I was born with two left feet.
mo You should go get one of the campers to help you.
mo To save time.
mo Don't pull any funny business. Okay?
m I wouldn't dare. The Guidelines shall be respected and obeyed at all times.
mo Oh, and take this. You'll need it.
m Thanks!
m I must be off!
m (My investigative eyes are still on you... Emily.)
m (Collect kindling and start the fire...)
m (I know the {i}perfect{/i} cultist to ask for help.)
n As you approach the girls' campground, you notice someone.
n Stacy is sitting on the stairs in front of her cabin...
n Looking off into the distance.
m Hi, Stacy. Am I interrupting?
s Oh, hello [m!t]. No, I was just practicing a form of meditation.
m Meditation? It looked like you had a stroke.
s *Giggles* No, no. I would look very different if I did.
s Why have you graced me with your presence, [m!t]?
m Oh, right.
m I need your help, but I think you'll enjoy this.
s I would enjoy doing many things with you...
m (Is she flirting with me again?)
m That's nice to hear, Stacy.
m For now, I just need your help collecting firewood...
s *Gasp* Yes?
m And kindling.
n Stacy cannot help but let out a tiny happy squeal.
s Oh, thank you for picking me, [m!t]!
s You allow me to offer tribute to the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus.
m (I mean, if considering it a tribute makes you happy to do work...)
m Of course.
m There's no one more appropriate for the task at hand than you.
m Fire is your thing after all.
s Fire is the light of life, [m!t].
m Follow me. I'll lead the way.
n You lead Stacy to a clearing under some trees.
n Fairly close to the fire pit.
m Now that we're here, we should look around and collect the kindling.
s I am attuned to the kindling, for I am kindling to the H.P.L.
m Ooookay... (Did she just imply she'd like to jump in the fire?)
m The only kindling we need today is dry wood, though.
s *Giggle* I am aware. I was just messing with you.
m *Phew* You got me with that one, Stacy.
s Good. I enjoy the look on your face when you're flustered.
n You and Stacy spend a little while collecting the right kindling.
m (You know, she isn't actually all that crazy.)
m (I'm having a nice time with her. And she's really... cute.)
n Stacy notices you watching her as she collects kindling.
n She turns to you and gives you a smile.
n You smile back.
m Stacy, I think we collected enough kindling.
s I thought we were just beginning.
s That is a shame... The flames may still hunger for more tribute...
m Don't worry, Stacy.
m I'll make sure to get enough firewood to satisfy the flame.
m And your Heavenly Phoenix Lotus.
s That is very thoughtful of you, [m!t].
s You'll make quite a prime member of the flock...
s Should you choose to join me.
m I'm still considering it.
m (It'll just take me another few years to give you an answer...)
s Who shall prepare the tribute tonight?
m Huh?
s Uhm... Who will start the fire?
s You, or I?
    s You, or I?
        n You see in her eyes how much it means to her...
        n So you give in.
        m Since it would mean so much to you to... \"offer tribute.\"
        s Yeees...
        m I'll allow you to start the campfire tonight.
        s Ooooh! Thank you, [m!t].
        s Your kindness will be remembered... by the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus!
        m Anything for the H.P.L.
        s *Whispers* You will be rewarded well for this, [m!t].
        n You are about to respond when Stacy comes in quickly...
        n Giving you a short but passionate kiss.
        s There's more of that waiting for you.
        m (That was... so sexy. Stacy...)
        s For now, we must prepare.
        m You're right. We should bring the kindling to the fire pit.
        n Still in a mild state of shock, you and Stacy walk to the fire pit.
        n You see in her eyes how much it means to her...
        n But, you also understand how dangerous that could be.
        n For everybody at the camp, and for Stacy herself.
        m (Eve would kill me if she found out I let the cute pyromaniac start the fire...)
        m I'm sorry Stacy...
        m Eve would kill me if she found out I didn't start the fire.
        n Stacy pouts, but looks as though she understands.
        m If you or another camper got burned...
        m Red Falls would be sued into bankruptcy.
        s You're probably correct...
        s However, I can't say I'm not disappointed.
        m Sorry, again.
        s You'll have to make it up to me some other way...
        m Anything, Stacy.
        s Okay. Then, we have a pact.
        m (A pact?)
        m (She better not be talking about a suicide pact...)
        n Both of you take what you gathered and make your way to fire pit.
n You drop the kindling off, and leave Stacy to it.
m Stacy, here's the rest of the kindling.
m I need you to prepare this while I go get the logs.
s May the Charred Kings keep you safe.
m Safe? There's nothing dangerous out here.
s *Giggle* I meant safe from yourself.
s You are prone to extreme clumsiness, from what I've witnessed.
m (Even she's pulling my leg?!)
m Ha-ha, that's a joke I've never heard before.
n Stacy gives you a cute smile as you leave to get firewood.
n It doesn't take long for you to arrive at the chopping stump.
n You collect a decent amount of logs.
m (I think this should do it.)
n You carefully carry the logs back to the fire pit.
n Where Stacy is awaiting your return.
s [m!ct]! Finally, you've returned.
s With proper tribute, I see.
m Yep. Got enough to last us most of the night.
s Wonderful. The fire will burn... passionately.
m Anything for your H.P.L.
s Hmm... [m!t]?
m Yes?
s I feel your fire burning brighter than before...
s You seem...
s Light, like fallen ash.
m (Even though she seems aloof, she's actually pretty attentive.)
m Do I?
m To be honest... Jane and I broke up.
s Oh, [m!t]... I am sorry for you.
m It's fine... It's for the best.
m I feel so much less...
s Inner conflict? Turmoil?
m Yeah. I feel lighter.
s That's wonderful...
s I am here for you if you need to talk.
m Thanks, Stacy.
m For now, though...
m We need to start this fire.
    m Actually...
    m {i}You{/i} need to start the fire.
    n Stacy's eyes glow passionately upon hearing this.
    s *Gasp* You would still allow me to pay tribute?
    m Who's a better choice to start the fire than you?
    n Stacy gives [m!t] another quick kiss before beginning the preparations.
    s Then, let me begin...
    n Stacy positions her body as if she were meditating...
    n And closes her eyes...
    n Before letting out a deep sigh and opening her eyes again.
    s I am nearly ready to begin.
        n Stacy pulls a crumpled up piece of paper from the center of her bra.
        m (Is that... Violet's diagnosis?)
        s You gave this to me previously.
        s A piece of paper with immense value.
        m Yeah, it's Violet's...
        s Precisely. It will be the heart of the flame.
        m (A bit weird...)
        m (It's almost like burning a voodoo doll of Violet...)
        m This won't... put any curses on Violet, right?
        s Of course not. The Heavenly Phoenix Lotus forbids curses.
        s As I said. This will be the heart.
        s The kindling is the flesh.
        s And the logs, the bones.
        m (Why is she making it sound like we're burning a body?)
        s All the ingredients needed for a sacred tribute.
        n Stacy stares intently at the unlit campfire.
        n It surprises you that with a stare that intense the fire doesn't ignite.
        m (Is she trying to start the fire with her mind?)
        m (Like a pyrokinetic or something?)
        s I am assessing the components.
        s The kindling is the flesh.
        s And the logs, the bones.
        s But I do feel the fire is missing a little... heart.
        m (Why is she making it sound like we're burning a body?)
        s We will supply that bit later.
        m (What does she mean by that?)
        s For now, this will do...
        s It's an acceptable tribute.
    s With that, all we need is the spark of life.
    n Stacy pulls a lighter out of her pocket.
    n The lighter you let her keep.
    m (She keeps that on her at all times?!)
    m (Maybe I shouldn't have let her keep that after all...)
    n Stacy gets closer to the fire and flicks the lighter.
    m (Damn her ass looks amazing...)
    n The fire starts quickly, burning all the kindling and fuel quickly.
    n The logs take a bit longer to ignite...
    n But, once they do, they burn brilliantly.
    s Such a beautiful sight...
    m I also love a good campfire.
    s Thank you for tonight, [m!t]. And, for letting me keep my undying ember.
    m (Does she mean the lighter?)
    s I have not had the chance to pay tribute like this...
    s For a while.
    m (I'm just glad we didn't burn the camp down.)
    m It's nothing, Stacy.
    n Stacy pulls you in for a gentle embrace...
    n Kissing you on the neck as she holds you.
    m (Boner, don't you dare ruin this moment!)
    n You hold each other a bit longer before Stacy lets you go.
    s We should be more... subtle.
    m You're right. Eve and the girls should be here soon.
    s Now, we need a spark...
    m Say no more.
    n In a swift motion...
    n You pull the lighter out of your pocket and present it to Stacy.
    m Here you go.
    s Thank you, [m!t].
    n As Stacy takes the lighter from your palm, she gently touches your fingers.
    m (Her hands are so soft...)
    n Stacy gets near the fire and flicks the lighter.
    m (Damn her ass looks good like that...)
    n The fire starts quickly, burning all the kindling and fuel.
    n The logs take a bit longer to ignite...
    n But, once they do, they burn brilliantly.
    s Such a beautiful sight...
    m I also love a good campfire.
    s Thank you for tonight, [m!t].
    s I have not had the chance to pay tribute like this...
    s For a while.
    m (I'm just glad we didn't burn the camp down.)
    m It's nothing, Stacy.
    n Stacy pulls you in for a gentle embrace...
    n Kissing you on the neck as she holds you.
    m (Boner, don't you dare ruin this moment!)
    n You hold each other a bit longer before Stacy lets you go.
    s We should be more... subtle.
    m You're right. Eve and the girls should be here soon.
    m Actually, I need to start the fire.
    n Stacy gives you a look of disappointed understanding.
    s It's because of those guidelines...
    m Yeah. I'm really sorry Stacy.
    s It's okay. At least I get to be an observer.
    s And I can lead you in paying tribute correctly.
    m So... Am I doing it right?
    s First, you need to consider the components of the tribute.
    m (Consider the what?)
    s The kindling is the flesh.
    s And the logs, the bones.
    s But I do feel the fire is missing a little... heart.
    m (Why is she making it sound like we're burning a body?)
    s For now, this will do...
    s It is an acceptable tribute.
    m I think it'll be a good fire.
    s We are not only considering utility, [m!t].
    s Each fire is sacred.
    s The quality of the components dictate the flame's connection to the...
    m H.P.L. Right, I got it.
    s Yes. Exactly.
    s Next, you must provide it with the spark of life.
    n Taking Stacy's cue...
    n You bend over and light the fire with the lighter Eve gave you.
    n The fire starts quickly, burning all the kindling and fuel quickly.
    n The logs take a bit longer to ignite...
    n But, once they do, they burn brilliantly.
    s Such a blessed sight...
    m I also love a good campfire.
    s May this fire please the Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus...
    s May the HPL envelop us in its golden-sparked plumage!
    s I am glad you chose me to help you with this, [m!t].
    m Well, you were a great help.
    s When will the others arrive?
    m Eve and the girls should be here soon.
n You and Stacy spend a few more minutes looking into the fire...
n Before Eve and the girls arrive.
mo Hello Stacy. [m!t].
m Hey Eve.
s Hello, Dr. Eve.
mo You guys really did a great job with the fire.
m Thanks, it was easy with Stacy's help.
mo I hope you supervised her.
m Of course. I made sure to keep things under control.
mo Great. Now, we can begin.
mo Ladies, take a seat around the campfire.
mo Wherever you feel most comfortable.
mo [m!ct], you can join us too. This could be helpful for you, as well.
m Really? This isn't going to be any deep psychoanalysis?
mo No. Tonight is something more lighthearted.
b So, we're not playing spin the bottle?
mo No, Belle.
b That's so lame.
mo You don't even know what we're doing yet...
mo Hey, you may even enjoy it.
m (What is Eve talking about?)
mo Tonight, we'll be playing the \"Life Highlights Game.\"
mo This is a game usually played during team building gatherings.
nao I know. This is something my daddy has his subordinates play.
nao He said it makes them more productive.
nao In turn, making us richer.
m (She is {i}such{/i} a spoiled daddy's girl...)
mo Can I continue, Naomi?
nao Go right ahead.
mo We'll go around the circle and talk about the biggest \"highlights\" of our lives.
mo Well... Of our lives so far.
mo To help you understand what I'm asking of you, I'll go first.
m (I wonder what Eve's highlights are?)
mo A highlight of my life is a trip I took a few years back.
mo I was working hard all year...
m (Huh... I haven't heard this story before.)
mo ...so I decided to treat myself.
mo I have dreamed of visiting Paris ever since I was a teenager.
b Aww... Paris, how romantic!
m (Paris? Why is Paris so special?)
mo One night, I met a charming stranger.
m (I definitely haven't heard this one.)
mo His name was Ã‰mile, and he had the most piercing blue eyes I have ever seen.
mo I told him I wanted to float down the Canal Saint-Martin eating brie on baguettes.
mo A glass of fine red wine in my hand.
mo And he promised me he'd be the captain.
mo So... We went off on our date, and he kept his promise.
mo The weather was beautiful. It was a warm autumn day.
mo He arrived at the hotel with the baguettes, wine and brie...
mo Got all dressed up as a mime... and ferried me down the canal.
b Really?! A mime?!
mo Yes.
b What did you do to this man to make him be so romantic with you?
mo Belle, if you let me continue my story maybe you'll get your answer.
n Hearing this, Belle quiets herself down and watches Eve attentively.
m (A mysterious man, wearing a mime outfit, ferrying Eve down a canal...)
m (I never thought I'd imagine that.)
m That really happened?
mo Yes, [m!t].
b Wooow...
b *Quietly* I hope I'm lucky enough to meet someone like him one day.
mo Another highlight of my life was building my career into what it is now.
mo I dreamed about helping people my whole life...
mo And now I have the opportunity to help.
mo That's all from me.
mo Violet, would you like to go next?
v Sure, I can go next.
v Well, my life's biggest highlight has to be...
v Hmm... Probably the time I won gold at the Children's Gymnastics Nationals.
v I trained 3 years for that event...
v Then, two days after my 10th birthday I got to compete.
v For me... that was the best birthday present I got that year.
v And, it was a present from past me, to the me in that moment...
v Me standing on that mark, ready to give it my all.
v I heard the crowd fall silent as I prepared for my first step...
v Actually, it was more of a leap.
v A leap that led into the most flawless routine I've done.
v Even to this day, that one is the most perfect.
v When I finished, and landed on my feet, I raised my hands to the air.
v The entire room remained silent...
v Until the judges began clapping. The crowd followed.
v I was famous for a day... But, I didn't love the limelight.
v I loved that perfect moment when my form was flawless.
v That's all from me.
mo Wow, Violet. Thank you for sharing that with us.
mo I'm sure you'll top that moment, in the future.
v Thank you, Dr. Eve.
mo Okay, next up is Belle.
mo Please make sure to keep the highlight PG-13...
b Well, that excludes like 90%% of my highlights, then...
mo I'm sure there are some in there that aren't exclusively lewd.
m (If only Eve knew that Belle's stories are {i}all{/i} lewd.)
b Then, I think I have one.
b I think my highlight is the day I started being an e-girl.
mo E-girl?
b How to put it... A hot online girl that has an army of... \"fans.\"
m (Of course this is the highlight Belle brings up...)
b Well. The day I began that hobby, I knew that was my destiny.
b I got to dress up in sexy clothes...
b ...and take them off.
b All for my fans, who shower me in attention and money.
b But, one thing it really did is unleash my sexuality.
b I've never felt so free, yet also in control.
b And, on top of it, I have tons of men under my thumb.
b That sounds like a highlight to me.
mo Well, we're not here to judge.
mo So... thank you for sharing, Belle.
b I just wish I could share {i}all the time.{/i}
mo If you could, then it wouldn't be as special. No?
mo Anyway, next up is Stacy.
s Thank you.
s There is no memory more worthy of this honor...
s Than when I was made one with the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus.
m (This sounds spicy.)
s I was just starting college, and I was a confused little girl.
s I was confused, purposeless.
s I did what all college students do.
s Partied, went wild, had tons of sex.
s But, I found no solace.
s After a few aimless months, I met a disciple...
s A bringer of truth. Of purpose.
s He brought me to where others of his flock gathered.
m (This took a quick turn...)
s They took me in. We became one.
m (Did she take part in some weird ritual orgy?!)
s I was reborn... with a purpose.
b Stacy, it sounds like you had an orgy.
s We did not. That came later... During lessons.
s That night we became one with the sacred flame of the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus.
s Through meditation and ritual...
m (So there was a ritual... just no orgy.)
s We were embraced by the Charred Kings.
s Forged together. Like kin.
s That was the highlight of my life...
s Becoming a petal in the Heavenly Phoenix Lotus' corolla.
mo That was very poetic, Stacy. Thank you.
mo Naomi, are you ready?
nao I'd rather not do this. But, okay.
nao The highlight of my life is my entire life.
nao *Laughs* Thank god I was born rich!
mo Naomi. Please take this more seriously.
mo You heard how honest the others were being...
nao Ugh. Okay, fine.
nao There was a time when I was little that my parents took me to our private island.
nao I got to swim with dolphins, and bask in the sun.
nao Things were simple... relaxing.
nao That was a point in my life when my parents weren't always busy with work...
nao Or hosting luncheons, or galas, or any of that shit.
nao I actually just had a really nice time with my family.
nao And we were having fun spending time together.
nao That's it.
mo See? That wasn't so hard.
mo Thank you, Naomi.
nao Yeah, yeah.
mo Well, [m!t]. What about you?
m Huh?
mo You've been sitting there quietly for a while.
mo Why don't you join us?
mo What is your highlight?
m (Oh shit, do I really have to do this?)
m Hmm...
m That's a hard question. I have a ton of highlights.
mo I'm sure any will suffice, [m!t].
nao Come on, you have to spill it!
s The flame would like to hear your tales, too!
v I wouldn't mind hearing one of your stories, [m!t].
b We all know most of them are about me, right?
m How'd you know?
b *Giggle* What? You're serious?
m Not exactly...
m You {i}were{/i} close, though, Belle.
mo Hmm?
m I'd have to say my highlight is the time I've gotten to spend here.
m At first, I was totally against it.
m Eve called me last minute, as well... asking me to come here, not taking no as an answer.
m Another summer lost to Red Falls...
m But, it actually hasn't been so bad.
m Other than the constant chores.
m I've had a good time being back here, and getting to know you all.
mo (Hopefully it's just that, and nothing more...)
m So, that's it. Thanks, everyone.
mo That was a bit... brief. Thank you anyway, [m!t].
mo I think we'll end it there. It's getting late...
mo However, all of you may spend a bit more time out here until the fire dies out.
s It will be a tragedy when it does.
mo Enjoy the rest of your night, everyone.
n Eve gets up and walks away from the campfire.
n Leaving you and the girls all alone.
n A bit of a quiet falls over the group around the fire.
n Until the silence is broken by Belle.
b Now that the buzzkill is gone...
b Let's have some {i}fun.{/i}
b That's your cue, Naomi.
nao Guess what I have...
n Naomi reaches behind the bench she's sitting on and pulls out a bottle.
b My old friend!
b (I guess Naomi found my secret stash.)
v What if Dr. Eve found that?
nao I'd just blame it on [m!t].
m Wow. {i}Really?{/i}
nao *Laughs* I'm serious, I swear!
m Should I be surprised?
b Oh, come on. Give it here, Naomi!
n In a swift motion, Belle gets up and takes the bottle from Naomi.
nao Hey! You bitch!
nao You better not drink it all.
b You think I'm that desperate for a drink?
nao I don't know. Your \"job\" seems preeetty hard...
nao You must throw back a few tall glasses of vodka a day.
b I just want to get in {i}the mood.{/i}
m (In the mood for {i}what?{/i})
s Let us just enjoy the fire as it burns...
s Pass the bottle to me, please.
v I agree with Stacy. Let's all just relax.
b Oh, does that mean Ms. Pro-Athlete will drink with us?
v Well... I don't know.
v (It is only 100 calories per shot...)
v Hmm...
nao So much thinking, so little action...
v Okay, okay... Uh, can I have a sip?
s May the ashes be soft and warm on your skin.
v Uhh... Okay. Thanks Stacy.
v I'll take that as a yes.
v (What was that look she gave me?)
nao Get a room, you two.
s I was being polite.
s One must give the appropriate amount of eye contact when sharing a drink.
m (For a second I also thought Stacy wanted to fuck Violet!)
m (The thought is kinda turning me on, actually...)
m Violet, can you pass the bottle here?
v Here you go, [m!t].
m That's a little something I learned at the frat parties.
b Ooooh. Frat parties?
b Did you learn to crush pussy there too, big man?
m *Laughs* I shouldn't say...
n The group gets more comfortable the more they drink and talk.
n Stacy is getting a bit sillier...
n Violet more open and comfortable.
n Naomi less pretentious.
n Belle is still as horny as ever.
m *Hic* You know, I'm actually having a pretty good time with you girls.
nao You say that like you weren't before.
m Well, I was, but...
b Now you're free?
m What?
m (Shit, how did she find out Jane and I broke up?)
b No more girlfriend to drag you down?
m How do you know that?
b You're terrible at keeping secrets.
nao You also talk pretty loudly.
nao *In [m!t]'s voice* \"Kiara... I'm so sad Jane and I broke up.\"
v Guys, come on...
v It's still fresh for him.
v (Did [m!t] and his girlfriend really break up?)
v (Is a part of me happy about this?)
m It's okay, Violet. You don't need to defend me.
m It was mutual. We needed to take a break.
b Look, learning this has been a bit of a downer...
b Let's make things fun again.
n Belle puts the closed bottle down in front of her on the ground.
b How about... spin the bottle?
b Let's consider it a DLC for the day's activities.
b *Whispers* A kinky DLC.
m (What did she just say? I could barely hear her.)
m What was that?
b Here. We'll play spin the bottle.
nao Everyone knows how to play that, Belle.
nao Except [m!t], maybe.
b I have different rules. Listen.
b We go in a circle and spin the bottle.
b Whoever the bottle points to, you have to kiss.
b What makes it different is that you need to take a shot if it points to you.
b Before you kiss.
m Uhh... I think I'll have to sit this game out, girls.
b Why is that?
m If anyone caught me breaking the holy guidelines...
s He'd surely be executed.
m Well, maybe not executed... but Eve's wrath {i}would{/i} make me wish for death...
b [m!ct], I promise we'll be discreet.
m Well, okay... I guess.
b You guess?!
b You get to play a fun game with sexy girls and your answer is \"I guess?\"
n The irritation and annoyed surprise is palpable on Belle's voice.
n For your own wellbeing, you decide it's best to just say \"yes.\"
m Fine, fine... I'll play.
m (Am I making another huge mistake?)
b Good. {i}You better.{/i}
n Belle spins the bottle.
n It spins for a while before landing on Naomi.
nao What the hell?! I don't want to kiss Belle...
nao The game is rigged!
nao You just wanted to play this for some lesbo action, didn't you!?
b Naomi. You know I'd choose a hard cock over a lesbian kiss any day.
nao That is... true.
nao Fine, let's just get this over with.
n Naomi quickly takes the shot...
n ...and gives Belle a kiss.
n Belle, however, makes it more sexy than Naomi intended.
nao What the fuck, Belle!?
nao Did you just slip me some tongue?
b *Giggle* Ooops!
b Thought I'd make it more fun for [m!t] to watch.
b He did have his reservations about playing, after all...
nao You're such a slut, Belle.
b *Chuckle* You can't deny that you liked it.
nao *Scoffs* In your dreams.
nao Now, it's my turn to spin.
n The bottle spins a few times before it stops spinning...
n ...in front of you.
m (Naomi has to kiss me? In front of everyone else...)
m (In private I wouldn't be so hesitant...)
nao Oh, isn't {i}this{/i} a surprise.
n You take a swig from the bottle.
nao Come here, [m!t].
n Naomi gives you a firm, yet gentle, kiss on the lips before leaning back.
nao That was better than I expected.
m (She has super soft lips.)
m *Whistles* Okay.
m Guess that means it's my turn.
n With a flick of the wrist, you send the bottle spinning.
n As the bottle goes round and round, you wonder who it will land on.
m (Who'll it be? Stacy? Belle? Maybe...)
n The bottle stops, pointing directly at Violet.
v (Oh my god...)
b Looks like you get a little piece of [m!t] too, Violet.
v Come on...
nao You should be happy.
v (I am happy... but, I didn't think it would be like this.)
m (Violet looks really uncomfortable right now...)
m It doesn't need to be a long kiss.
m (I should make this as easy as possible, for her.)
m Look, you can even kiss me on the cheek if you want.
m I'll leave it up to you.
v Okay...
v (If it's up to me...)
v (Then I need to take the chance.)
n Violet takes a quick swig from the bottle for courage.
n Moving toward you and kissing you on the cheek.
m There. That wasn't so hard, was it?
b *Gasps* Booooo! 
nao Violet, you can't chicken out like that!
b Here I was thinking you were this fearless Amazon...
nao Turns out she's just a little chicken.
b Cheep cheep cheeeep.
v I'm not a chicken!
v (If they want to see my \"Amazonian\" side, fine!)
n With her newfound courage, Violet grabs your head...
n Pulling you in for a kiss on the lips.
n The mood the campfire gives off enhances the moment.
m (Wow... That was...)
v There! Was that good enough, girls?
m (That was perfect...)
b I think [m!t]'s face says it all, Violet.
s I think that's enough for tonight...
s The fire burns low.
v I am beginning to get kinda tired.
v I woke up pretty early...
v Though, not as early as you, [m!t].
nao Yeah, yeah. We all know you do yoga, Violet.
m Come on, less passive aggression...
m Anyway.
m Since the fire is burning out and some of you are getting tired...
m I think we should call it a night.
m (If we kept going like this I'd be torn to shreds by sunrise...)
m (They clearly don't want to share me.)
nao What? You have better plans for the night?
b Naomi, he needs to jerk off after all this sexual tension.
m (She knows me {i}way{/i} too well...)
m You are all still at a rehab camp, by the way.
m There's a high likelihood Eve will want you up early.
nao She {i}always{/i} interrupts my beauty sleep.
m *Chuckles* She really does value punctuality.
m I'll clean up here. Goodnight, girls.
n The girls all head off to their cabins to sleep.
n As you put out the remaining fire...
n You take a good look at the girls as they leave.
m (What I once considered a curse...)
m (Has actually become a blessing.)
m (I never would have imagined I'd have a night like this at Red Falls.)
m (I'd say this is a worthy addition to my life highlights.)
n Stacy lingers to the back of the group walking away.
    n She turns, for a moment, giving you a seductive look that pierces your heart.
    n And sends all the blood in your body to your huge member.
    m (Shit, it's like she's in control of my cock...)
    n You wave at her and she turns away, continuing back to her cabin.
    m (The things I'd love to do to her...)
    m If only.
    n You finish putting out the fire and cleaning up the area.
    n Having finished the cleanup, you take a good look at the stars.
    m *Exhales* Ah. The great outdoors.
    m I should go camping more often.
    n You look over the campground, and begin walking back to the house.
    n She turns for a moment, looking back at you.
    n There is a warmth, but also a longing, in her eyes.
    m (Why does she look a bit sad?)
    m (Did I do something wrong?)
    n You wave at her and she turns away, continuing back to her cabin.
    m (Maybe I should trust her more...)
    m (I have been treating her like a dangerous pyromaniac.)
    m But she is, isn't she?
    n You finish putting out the fire and cleaning up the area.
    n Having finished the cleanup, you take a good look at the stars.
    m *Exhales* Ah. The great outdoors.
    m I should go camping more often.
    n You look over the campground, and begin walking back to the house.
n It takes you a little while to get back to the house.
m (Why couldn't the fire pit be closer to the house?)
n You notice that all the lights are off.
m Guess everybody is already sleeping.
n You quietly make your way across the entryway.
n Up the stairs.
n And back to your room.
    n You notice something odd...
    m (Why isn't my door shut?)
    m (Has someone been snooping through my room?)
    m *Whispering* Who's there?
    noname Why did you make me wait so long, [m!t]?
    n You step inside your room. And, as your eyes adjust to the darkness...
    n You're greeted by Stacy, lying on your bed...
    n In nothing but sexy lingerie.
    s Are you {i}entranced{/i} by what you see?
    m (Holy shit!)
    m You surprised me, Stacy.
    m What are you doing here?
    s I think you're aware why I'm here.
    n You close the door behind you quietly.
    m Everyone is sleeping, Stacy.
    s Then we'll be sure to stay quiet like fallen ash.
    s Come to me, [m!t].
    n Stacy pulls you slowly to the bed. You put up no resistance...
    m This seems planned out, Stacy...
    s You made me wait quite some time for this opportunity...
        s You've been so good to me, [m!t]...
        s You gave me such valuable kindling.
        s It was a beautiful tribute...
        m Violet's..?
        s Yes. The heart of our fire earlier.
        s Now I want to give you something in return.
        s A bit of my heart... my {i}passion.{/i}
        n Stacy comes closer to you and removes your shirt.
        n And then, your pants.
        s Good, now I can see so much more of you.
        m What should I...
        s Sshh... just allow the flames to guide you.
        s Come here.
        n Stacy kisses you passionately as she slides her hand across your bare chest.
        n She spends more time touching your pecs.
        s Your body is... perfect.
        s Forged in the Heavenly smelter...
        n She savors every moment as she slides her hands down toward your crotch.
        s You really must join our flock...
        s Your genes are...
        n You see that Stacy wants to enjoy you...
        n But, you also want to enjoy her...
        m Hmm... (I can see she wants me...)
        m (But, I also want to make her feel good...)
        m (Which way should this go?)
            n Should you take control?
                n Before Stacy could finish what she was saying, you grab her by the waist...
                n Bringing her closer.
                n You give her a passionate kiss, and grab her hand...
                n Placing it firmly on your now-erect cock.
                m Feel that?
                s Oh... [m!t].
                s It's so large.
                m (She really knows what to say to a man.)
                n In your moment of lust, your hands begin caressing Stacy's body.
                n Her skin is hot to the touch...
                n It trembles with excitement as your fingertips glide across her figure.
                s Your touch sets my skin alight...
                m Good... What about this?
                n At that moment, your hands glide to Stacy's breast, and vagina.
                s Mmmh...
                n Despite being covered by lingerie, she still appears to enjoy your touch.
                n If anything, having so little fabric between her skin and your hands only excites her more.
                n You begin touching her with more intent... more passion.
                s Oooh... Heavenly...
                m (Fuck, she looks so hot...)
                n Stacy writhes in pleasure beneath your fingertips...
                n As your touch excites her most sensitive areas.
                s *Mumbles* Inside...
                m What was that?
                s Fill me with more of your warmth... Your touch.
                n Without hesitation, you gently slide two fingers under her panties...
                n ...and into her hot, tight, pussy.
                s Yes... your tribute is... Mmm.
                m Acceptable?
                s Thoroughly pleasing...
                n You continue fingering Stacy, bringing her closer to climax...
                m Wait, wait...
                s Aahh... Why have you stopped?
                m I think it's time to change things up a bit.
                m (And slow down. Like that, she would have been finished too quickly.)
                s Smart decision, [m!t]. We do want this to continue...
                s How about this?
                n Stacy removes her lingerie...
                n Then begins undressing you. Quickly... {i}passionately.{/i}
                m If you keep doing that...
                s You'll be free like a raging wildfire?
                s {i}Excellent, then.{/i}
                n Stacy entices you seductively, and you can't restrain yourself...
                n Like a wild animal, you grab Stacy by the hips.
                n Turn her around and grind her ass on your cock.
                m Do you like this?
                s This is wonderful, [m!t].
                    s This is wonderful, [m!t].
                        s Oh, [m!t]!
                s But wouldn't you find {i}this{/i} more pleasurable?
                n At that second, Stacy surprises you by sliding your cock into her wet pussy.
                s Oooohhh... You're so big, [m!t].
                m (Shiiiit this feels good!)
                m You're pretty amazing too, Stacy.
                s Harder, [m!t]...
                n You keep fucking Stacy's tight pussy.
                m Oh yeah...
                m (She's amazing! Her pussy is fire!)
                s Wait a moment...
                n Stacy pushes you onto the bed again, and gets on top of you.
                m You want to take charge?
                s I think we would both find this the most pleasurable...
                n She takes your cock and lines it up with her ass.
                m Oh? You want that?
                n With all her force, she sits on your throbbing cock.
                m OH FUCK... Stacy...
                s OOOH! OOOH!
                m Sssh... we need to be more quiet.
                s Well then... make me quiet.
                n You notice Stacy take a deep breath, as if she's going to moan loudly...
                n But put your hand on her mouth before she can.
                m You need to be quiet, Stacy.
                m Or else we'll get caught...
                n You see the pleasure on her face as you hold her mouth shut.
                n Silencing her moans of orgasmic pleasure from fucking her in the ass.
                m *Whispers* You like it like this? Do you?
                n You slide your cock out of her ass momentarily.
                s *Muffled* Mhhmhmmm...
                m Good. Then we can continue.
                n You thrust your cock deep inside Stacy's petite ass.
                n Her eyes roll back into her head in pleasure.
                m Didn't expect that?
                s *Muffled* Aaahha...
                n Suddenly, her asshole tightens around your cock and you feel something rising...
                m (Oh shit, I'm gonna...)
                n As Stacy orgasms while sitting on your cock you can't help but cum too.
                m (She's getting so tight...)
                m Aaaah! *Quietly* Fuck...
                m (I didn't have time to choose where to cum...)
                n You turn on your bed, releasing Stacy from your cock.
                n She is still twitching from the waves of her orgasm.
                m Are you okay?
                s Mmmmm... Y... Yes.
                s Kiss my body, please... [m!t].
                n Without hesitation, you make this morning's fantasy a reality.
                n Kissing Stacy's entire body.
                s Aahhh...
                n Sending electric jolts of pleasure through her body...
                n Eventually making your way to her clitoris.
                s *Moans* Ah... No, not there. I'm still too sensitive.
                n She pushes your head away from her clitoris...
                n And kisses you on the lips.
                n Without hesitation Stacy begins stroking your cock over your boxers.
                s These are getting in my way.
                s That's better.
                s Lie back on the bed, [m!t].
                n Stacy gets on her knees and begins licking your shaft.
                n She continues licking your shaft, until suddenly...
                n She slides your cock into her eager mouth.
                m Aaahh!
                m Oh yeah... Keep going...
                s Aah. You want more, [m!t]?

                n Your hand involuntarily moves to the back of her head...
                m (I bet she'll enjoy it if I give her a little... affirmation.)
                m Do you like this, Stacy?
                s Mhhmm...
                n You feel close to completion, and pull Stacy's head off of your dick.
                m Wait, wait...
                s What, why have you stopped me?
                m I think it's time to change things up a bit.
                m (And slow down. Like that, I would have been finished too quickly.)
                s Smart decision, [m!t]. We {i}do{/i} want this to continue...
                s How about this?
                m If you keep doing that...
                s You'll be wild like a raging flame?

                n Turn her around and grind her ass on your cock.
                m Do you like this?
                s This is wonderful, [m!t].
                    s This is wonderful, [m!t].
                        s Oh, [m!t]!
                s But wouldn't you find {i}this{/i} more pleasurable?
                n At that second, Stacy surprises you by sliding your cock into her wet pussy.
                s Oooohhh... You're so big, [m!t].
                m (Shiiiit this feels good!)
                m You're pretty amazing too, Stacy.
                s Harder, [m!t]...
                n You keep fucking Stacy's tight pussy.
                m Oh yeah...
                m (She's amazing! Her pussy is fire!)
                s Wait a moment...
                n Stacy pushes you onto the bed again, and gets on top of you.
                m You want to take charge?
                s I think we would both find this the most pleasurable...
                n She takes your cock and lines it up with her ass.
                m Oh? You want that?

                m OH FUCK... Stacy...

                m Sssh... we need to be more quiet.
                s Well then... make me quiet.
                n You notice Stacy take a deep breath, as if she's going to moan loudly...
                n But put your hand on her mouth before she can.
                m You need to be quiet, Stacy.
                m Or else we'll get caught...
                n You see the pleasure on her face as you hold her mouth shut.
                n Silencing her moans of orgasmic pleasure from fucking her in the ass.

                n You slide your cock out of her ass momentarily.
                s *Muffled* Mhhmhmmm...
                m Good. Then we can continue.
                n You thrust your cock deep inside Stacy's petite ass.
                n Her eyes roll back into her head in pleasure.
                m Didn't expect that?
                s *Muffled* Aaahha...
                n Suddenly, her asshole tightens around your cock and you feel something rising...
                m (Oh shit, I'm gonna...)
                n As Stacy orgasms while sitting on your cock you can't help but cum too.
                m (She's getting so tight...)
                m Aaaah! *Quietly* Fuck...
                m (I didn't have time to choose where to cum...)
                n You turn on your bed, releasing Stacy from your cock.
                n She is still twitching from the waves of her orgasm.

                n Eventually making your way to her clitoris.
                s *Moans* Ah... No, not there. I'm still too sensitive.
                n She pushes your head away from her clitoris...
                n And kisses you on the lips.
        s [m!ct]...
        m Yes?
        s I'm truly grateful that you helped me... earlier.
        m (Helped her? Does she mean..?)
        s So, now I'm going to help you.
        n Stacy comes closer to you and removes your shirt.
        n And then, your pants.
        s Good, now I can see so much more of you.
        m What about..?
        s Shhh... just allow the flames to guide you.
        n Hearing Stacy say that, you reach out and touch her breast.

        s I knew you'd appreciate its beauty.
        m I appreciate... your beauty.
        n Stacy feels your touch spread across her body in a wave of warmth...
        n Stacy comes closer and begins kissing your neck.
        s Does this pleasure you, [m!t]?
        m (This makes me fuckin' rock-hard!)
        m Yeah.
        s Good... Now, lie back onto the bed.
        n You listen to Stacy's command and lie back onto the bed.
        n Once you do, she pulls your underwear off and lies on top of you.

        m I'll share it all.
        n You begin kissing Stacy on the lips passionately.
        s Mmmm... You're such an amazing kisser.
        s But... I need more.
        n You look deeply into Stacy's eyes...
        n As you contemplate how to satisfy Stacy's desires.
        m (What should I do? I can't restrain myself... but maybe I should?)
            m (Should I be dominant and firm, or gentle with her?)
                n You grab Stacy...
                n Pulling her in for a kiss with your strength.
                s Oh, [m!t]. You really are a man.
                n Without warning, Stacy mounts your face.
                n Her hot, wet pussy sitting right on your mouth.
                m Mmmffh. (Fuck! She's so wet I'm going to drown!)
                n The only thing you can do in this position is lick her pussy vigorously.
                m (Let's see how she likes this.)
                s Mmhmm... Yes.
                s You're making me burn up...
                n Stacy is visibly grinding your face, taken by intense pleasure.

                n You decide to suck on her clitoris a bit...
                s AAHH! YESsss...
                n Stacy's body begins twitching...
                n And, she orgasms on your face.
                m *Muffled* Mmmph.
                n Slowly, Stacy's body stops twitching, and her orgasm subsides.
                n She composes herself, and shifts position...
                n Your hand glides sensually down Stacy's head...
                n Until you reach her cheek.
                m Stacy... You're so beautiful.
                n As you say this, you lean in closer and gently kiss her.
                s [m!ct], you're being so gentle with me...
                m It's because you're so delicate, like a flower.
                s (He's so thoughtful).
                n Stacy reacts positively to your gentleness.
                n She repositions herself...
        n Slowly sliding down your body, onto your cock.
        s You just keep being so selfless... helping me.
        s I must repay you.
        n Stacy starts sliding her pussy up and down your rock hard shaft.
        n You enjoy it as much as possible before Stacy eagerly pushes your cock inside her pussy.
        m Oohh. Fuuuuck... Stacy.
        m You're so tight... so hot.
        s Am I causing you pain?
        m No, it's fuckin' great...
        s Then I will continue.
        n Stacy continues riding your cock.
        n Her face conveys a level of pleasure you didn't see on a girl's face in a long time.

        m I can't hold...
        n Until you can't hold it any longer.
        s Then don't.
        n You release a huge load into her mouth.
        n She has a bit of trouble containing it all, but manages to. Swallowing it all.
        s Mmm... Thank you for that tribute, [m!t].
        m (Why does she have to say shit like this, right now?)
        m You're... welcome.
        s Oh, but I'm not finished with you.
        m (More?! I guess it's my lucky night.)
        n She gets up and moves to the bed.
        n Standing next to the bed, Stacy bends over...
        n ...exposing her bare ass and pussy to you.

        m Oh, I'll fuck you...
        n You leave Stacy eagerly waiting... just a moment longer.
        n Until you can no longer hold back and begin rubbing her ass with your cock.
        m Oooh. Which will I choose?
        s The one that beckons you. My wet pussy...
        n You contemplate stuffing your huge cock into her asshole...
        m (I'd love to fuck that tight little ass...)
        n ...but decide against it.
        m Okay, I decided...
        s But...
        n You slide your giant cock into her pussy and feel it tighten against you.
        s *Moans* Slowly...
        m I thought you want it?
        s I do... too much. I'll lose my mind if you go too quickly.
        m (She didn't already lose her mind?)
        m Okay, I'll be gentle...
        m (At first.)
        n You fuck her gently, at first... but begin speeding up as time goes on.
        s *Moans* Oh, yes. YES.
        s Faster... [m!t]. Harder!
        m SSshhh... People are sleeping, Stacy.
        s If you want me to be quiet, fuck me harder.
        m (That seems counterproductive... but I could never stop now.)
        n You pound Stacy with your cock, harder and harder.
        n Until you feel her pussy tighten around you.
        m AAAH. Fuuuck...
        n You never had a chance to get it out before you came...
        m (I'm cumming!)
        n Releasing a huge load into her orgasming pussy.
        m *Grunts* Staaaacy.
        s Mmm... I am full of your body's fire, [m!t].
        s You gave me so much loving, and attention.
        s You worshiped me, like fire, tonight.
        m It was noth...
        n Before you can finish your sentence, she gets up and kisses you.
        n Holding you close to her for a moment, before letting you go.
        s I will remember this moment fondly, [m!t].
        s I hope you will too.
    n You close the door behind you and sit on the bed.
    m (I'm strangely turned on by that spin the bottle session...)
    m (I could use a good fap...)
    n You get up, and walk over to your desk.
    n You open your laptop and open your web browser.
    m (My boner won't go away unless I do something about it.)
    m (Hmm... What should I watch, though?)
    m (Some quick-and-easy porn videos?)
    m (Maybe some highlights from my favorite visual novel?)
    m (Oh... Or... I could check out more of \"Belle Mermaid's\" website?)
        m (Hmm... What should I watch?)
            m (It would be a little weird to fap to Belle, right?)
            m (Maybe I'm missing out... but whatever. My loss.)
            m (I don't really have much time, so the visual novel is out.)
            n Resigning yourself to a quick and easy fap session...
            n You subconsciously type in the URL of your favorite porn website.
            m (YourPorn.tits it is, then...)
            n You browse the homepage, scanning for any video that catches your eye.
            m (Big titty goth gfs... Ass fucking... 69... Hmm...)
            n Eventually, a video catches your eye and you click on it.
            m (I guess tonight it's \"Dripping Wet Stewardess Threesome\").
            n You automatically begin stroking your cock as the video plays.
            m (I'd join the mile high club with them if I could...)
            m (Ladies, there's enough of my cock to go around.)
            m (Please remain seated until the fasten seatbelt light turns off.)
            m ({i}Then{/i} I'll fuck the three of you...)
            n As you fantasize about the threesome and adherence to airline safety rules...
            n Your cock gets harder and harder.
            m (Oh fuck... Yeah...)
            m (This... is your... pilot... speaking.)
            m (Will all stewardesses report to the cabin for a good fucking?)
            m (Thank... you...)
            n Right as the video is reaching its end...
            n A feeling rises in you like you're about to burst.
            n You cum, blowing your load on your underwear.
            m (Well, Belle might be hot...)
            m (But I also know what {i}I{/i} like.)
            n You go to a folder on your computer and open the game Lewd Island.
            m (I really love this game...)
            m (Bella is so sexy...)
            m (I'd fuck her so hard if I could...)
            m (I wonder if she's based on someone real?)
            n Realizing you're slightly distracted, you go to your favorite scene...
            n The female protagonist, Bella, getting fucked in the shower.
            m (Oh yeah... this scene is fuckin hot.)
            m (I'd love to fuck her... right there.)
            n You stroke your cock automatically to the scene as it unfolds.
            n You feel your cock get harder as you imagine yourself as the protagonist.
            m (You want this, Bella? I'll give it to you...)
            m (I'd give it to you anywhere you want.)
            n Your cock begins to twitch as the scene also reaches its climax.
            m (I'll give you my hot load, Bella...)
            n As Bella orgasms, you cum too...
            n Blowing your load all over your underwear.
            m (OH YEAH... TAKE IT ALL, BELLA!)
            m (That slut winds me up so much and always blue-balls me...)
            m (The least she can do is make it up to me with her nudes...)
            m (Luckily, they're here for everyone to see...)
            m (So I'm not a creep for enjoying them.)
            n You go to your browser history and click on the URL for Belle Mermaid's website.
            m (Ohoho... What's this?)
            m (New photos? From Red Falls?)
            m (Where did she find a phone on camp?)
            m (Hmm... Who knows.)
            n You find some especially sexy videos of Belle playing with herself.
            m (Those are pretty big dildos... And, anal beads?)
            n The kinkiness of Belle's videos turns you on...
            n You begin stroking your cock automatically.
            m (Fuck yeah... Belle. You slut.)
            m (I bet you love it when men cum for you... Even more {i}on{/i} you.)
            m (If I could, I'd cum all over your slutty face...)
            n The thoughts you're having while stroking your cock to Belle's pictures turns you on even more.
            m (Fuck... {i}yeah.{/i} Show me your tits, your pussy... That tight asshole...)
            n You keep getting harder, and more horny, until you feel it coming...
            m (Oh yeah? You want it Belle?!)
            n You cum, blowing your load all over your underwear.
            m (FUCKING TAKE IT!)
n You didn't realize that while you were doing what you were doing...
n Someone had woken up, and investigated the noises coming from your room.
n The door had opened slowly...
n Emily watched you...
n ...and touched herself.
n Eventually, you look toward the door and notice it ajar.
n At first, you think nothing of it.
n But, suddenly, you're hit by the realization...
n That you closed the door earlier.
n In the darkness of the hall...
n Illuminated only by the dull glow of the light coming from your room...
n You lock eyes with the peeper.
n You're both frozen in absolute horror at the realization...
n ...that Emily was watching you the whole time...
n ...and you just spotted her, peeping.
