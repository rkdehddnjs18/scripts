b "*Chuckle* A safe space?"

v "Since nobody else is going to, I'll start."

v "It's no problem, Dr. Eve."
v "Someone had to break the ice."
mo "To make this easier for you, I'll ask you a question."
mo "What is something you like about yourself?"
v "Well... I like that I take care of myself."
mo "Great example, Violet."
mo "It's a good trait, to care for oneself."
mo "Would you like to continue?"
v "Of course."
v "Umm... I'd also say I value my inner strength."
v "The effort I give when I commit to something."

nao "*Sigh* Fine, I'll comply with your request."

b "Every now and then I do speedruns on my second channel."
v "What's a speedrun?"
b "It's where you play a game and try to beat it as quick as possible."

s "Although you all think I'm some loony..."
s "What I follow is more of a personal philosophy."
s "Understand?"
mo "Well--"
s "That warmth... it's not purely external."
s "It's not that my god is smiling upon me, bathing me in its warmth."

mo "Hmm..."

n "As Eve finished that sentence, a hush fell over the group."

mo "This is nothing to be afraid of."
n "Still, despite Eve's kind reassurances, the girls were quiet."
mo "Someone has to be first..."
mo "But, if it's so difficult, I can choose one of you at random."

mo "Do any of you have a proposal for a different selection method?"
n "Silence, total silence."
n "Not even a cricket could be heard chirping."
mo "Okay... How about..."
v "I guess I'll go first..."
v "...{i}again.{/i}"

nao "I'd have to agree."
nao "You seemed like you'd never come out of your shell when we first met."

mo "We're really making some progress here, ladies."
mo "Naomi, how about you go next?"
nao "Sure."
nao "So..."
nao "Uhm..."
nao "I guess I can be pretty rude."
nao "To the point of being cold."
mo "That's a fairly common defense mechanism."
nao "Yeah, I know."
mo "Would you say you're anxious when meeting new people?"
nao "Maybe."
nao "I never felt anxious..."
nao "More like I couldn't be honest with fresh faces."
nao "Maybe I was afraid."
mo "It's okay to feel that way, Naomi."

b "I don't think there's anything wrong with me."
mo "Everybody has flaws, Belle."

b "I think I could tone-down the teasing."

b "*Sigh* Yeah... I know."

s "Sure..."
s "The thing I dislike the most about myself..."
s "To be honest, I used to dislike myself more in the past."
mo "Then, you've made good progress since then."
s "Yeah... But, the big thing now is how I handle stress."
mo "Can you elaborate on that?"
s "Sure. When I get stressed, I don't sleep that well..."
s "Then my mind becomes... foggy."
mo "Hmm..."
mo "I see. Does anything else happen when you get stressed?"
s "I don't know. I just feel exhausted, drained."
s "Like a flickering flame about to be snuffed out."
mo "Thank you... Stacy."
n "Eve seems concerned by Stacy's response to the question."
n "However, to keep the atmosphere calm, she continues as if nothing is wrong."
mo "Ladies, I have to say, I'm quite proud of you all."
mo "You spoke openly, and honestly."
mo "That's one of the hardest things to do."
mo "Some people never manage to allow themselves to be that open."
mo "That's it for today."
mo "However, we'll start the campfire later."
mo "I've even decided to throw in a little surprise reward for your work today."
b "Oooh, a surprise?"

mo "Wow, that was quite the clean cut, [m!t]."
m "Oh. Hey, Eve."
m "Didn't notice you there."
mo "Makes sense. It looks like you've been busy."
m "Yep. I thought I could lend a hand during my free time."
mo "That's very kind of you, [m!t]."
mo "Would you care to take a walk?"
m "Is something wrong?"
mo "Not at all."
mo "I'd just like some company on my evening walk."
mo "And, you look like you could use a bit of a break."
m "That I could."
m "So, why not?"
mo "Wonderful."
mo "I'll lead the way."
mo "So, have you had a good day?"
m "I have."
m "I feel like I've finally settled in."
mo "That's wonderful."
m "How are you doing, Eve?"
mo "I'm doing well, [m!t]."
mo "Thank you for asking."
m "Uhh, where are we going?"
mo "Oh, my usual afternoon route."
mo "A nice, easy walk around the shore."
m "Ah. That sounds nice."
mo "Oh, it is quite nice."
mo "I see shooting stars quite regularly."
m "That's awesome."
m "I've only seen a few since I got here."

mo "Well, what would you like to talk about?"
m "Oh, I don't know."

    m "How about..."
        m "I think I'd rather talk about college."
        mo "Well, then, how are things at college?"
        mo "Having fun?"
        m "It's okay, I guess. Some subjects are really boring."
        m "Math is giving me a massive headache."

        m "No way!"
        m "I knew it! I knew you weren't such goody-two-shoes."
        mo "We all carry secrets."
        m "I'm all ears."

        mo "Oh, I'm so sorry, [m!t]."
        mo "How are you feeling?"
        m "I'm okay. I mean, I'm a bit sad."
        m "I like Jane, but there's a lot of things happening in my life right now."
        m "I can't give her what she needs and deserves. I don't think it's fair to her."
        mo "You're very mature about it. I'm glad you're considering her feelings in such a way."
        mo "It's very commendable."
        mo "You never told me what kind of girls you fancy."
        m "I don't have a type, per se. Not when it comes to looks, anyway."
        mo "So personality comes first?"
        m "Well, yeah. Shouldn't it?"
        mo "Of course."
        mo "Having a pretty face doesn't hurt, though."
        m "Dr. Eve!"
        m "So you {i}are{/i} like the rest of us."
        mo "You would be surprised."
        mo "Back to my question, what should the girl of your dreams have then?"
        m "Humor, for sure. Intelligence. Playfulness."
        mo "The magical trio. I like it."
        m "Good luck to me."
        mo "What? You don't think that's easy to find?"
        m "Not really. The hookup culture is taking over. Makes finding someone special that much harder."
        mo "There's no shame in casually hanging out with more girls."
        mo "How would you know what you like and need if you don't experiment?"
        m "Oh, so you're condoning one night stands?"
        mo "I didn't say that. The most important thing is to be respectful and considerate."
        m "I try to be."
        mo "Good. I never doubted it."
        mo "Oh, would you look at that."
        m "Hmm?"
        mo "The sun is already setting."
        mo "There's something I need to go prepare."
        mo "I'll see you soon, [m!t]."

        mo "So, are you enjoying your time here?"
        m "I wouldn't say {i}enjoy{/i}, but I'm warming up to it."
        mo "Emily missed you quite a bit, you know."
        m "Yeah, she's been pestering me to hang out with her more."
        mo "She looks up to you. Of course she wants to hang out more."
        m "I would if Mrs. Counselor gave me more free time."
        mo "We can work something out. You've been working hard and deserve some time off."
        m "Thanks."
        mo "What do you think of the girls?"
        m "They're... interesting."
        mo "Oh? In what way?"
        m "(Is she fishing for information or...?)"
        m "Just in general. They are all unique, and very different from each other."
        m "They bicker a lot, but I think they're growing on each other."
        mo "Very perceptive of you, [m!t]."
        mo "Ah yes, team spirit is something we want to focus on more."
        mo "Bonding is a very powerful element in therapy."
        m "It is?"
        mo "Of course. Sharing the same experience and emotions makes the patients more appreciative of..."
        mo "...what therapy has to offer them."
        m "Do you think everyone will be successful?"
        mo "That depends on a lot of factors. Therapy is just a starting point."
        mo "Self-motivation is crucial to this process."
        m "What do you mean? Like, they need to want it?"
        mo "Yes. If they believe they don't need help, the chances are, therapy won't have the same effect."
        m "I see... So for some it's hopeless?"
        mo "I wouldn't say that, no. It just means we can't have the same approach for everyone."
        mo "It's all about fine-tuning it."
        m "It sounds exhausting."
        mo "At times. But that's the beauty of it."
        mo "It's rewarding for the patients, as well as the therapist."
        mo "Have you ever considered being a therapist?"
        m "Hmm, it has crossed my mind..."
        mo "Think about it. You've got talent."
        m "I'll consider it."
        mo "Wonderful."

        m "In the dream, my door was also stuck for a while."
        m "I was trapped in my room."

mo "I was thinking we could share some campfire stories."
mo "To make it easier for you all, I'll break the ice."

mo "Okay, I think I've picked a good one."
mo "This is a story my mother told me when I was young."

m "Mine as well."
m "I don't think I've heard this one."
mo "Oh, no. You haven't heard this one yet, [m!t]."
m "Nice. Then, please indulge us."
mo "So..."
mo "When my mother was young she grew up in a small town deep in the Adirondacks."
mo "It was a quaint little town, and everybody knew each other well."
mo "Heck, they even left their doors unlocked."
mo "That's how trusting of each other they all were."
b "I wish people still did that..."
b "Things would be much more fun."
mo "And much more dangerous, Belle."
mo "These days naivety isn't virtuous, it's foolish."
mo "And, the town? Today, it's nothing more than a ghost town."
mo "You probably couldn't even find it maps, anymore."
mo "Anyway... My mother once told me of a story from that town."
mo "The story of the Disappearing Fog."
mo "So, the area the town was built in was always known to be strange."
mo "Even when the first settlers got there, they knew that something was {i}off.{/i}"
mo "Especially the pond nearby."
mo "Over by the pond, it was always silent."
mo "Not a chirp could be heard, and no animals could be found there."
mo "They avoided that place, for some unknown reason."
mo "However, the settlers told a tale."
mo "A tale passed down, generation to generation..."
mo "To protect themselves from the unknowns that existed out there."
mo "I doubt it's little more than a folk tale to scare children away from a dangerous pond."
mo "However, a tiny part of me believes the story."
mo "So... Long ago, the settlers' children used to roam the woods for fun."
mo "That is... until they began disappearing."
mo "Some kids that went into the woods never returned."
v "Disappearing? The settlers never found them?"
mo "Yes... mostly."
mo "The one case that really shook the townsfolk was the child who returned."
mo "One day this little boy went into the woods, but didn't return by sundown."
mo "All the men from the town went out to look for him..."
mo "...as they did with all the others that disappeared."
mo "The search party spent {i}days{/i} looking for him..."
mo "...to no avail."
mo "However, weeks later, a trapper went out to check his fur traps..."
mo "...and found the little boy."
mo "He was disoriented and confused..."
mo "The trapper asked him where he had been, and that his parents were worried sick."
mo "And, the boy told the trapper everything he could remember."
mo "That he had wandered close to that pond, and a fog had bubbled up from it..."
mo "...and spread quickly."
mo "The boy even believed that it was following him."
mo "As if it were alive."
mo "While running from the fog, he eventually tripped."
mo "And the fog swallowed him whole."
    n "You start drifting away, wondering what could have happened..."
nao "What happened to him?"
mo "When asked by his parents,"
mo "the child could only remember being taken to a place like a dream."
mo "As every second went by, he remembered less and less of that dream-like place."
mo "But, the one thing that was truly strange to the search party was how clean he was."
mo "Especially considering he had been missing almost two weeks."
mo "Another thing they found strange was that he was missing his shoes and socks."
mo "From that point on, the people called the fog the Disappearing Fog."
mo "It was blamed for all the children who had disappeared over the years."
mo "But, I believe that was just their way to rationalize it."
b "Rationalize what?"
mo "To rationalize that the children were most likely eaten by predatory animals."
nao "That's grim..."
mo "Sadly, that's how most of these old folk tales started."
mo "There is one truly strange thing about my mother's story."
m "What?"
mo "Well, she said that the morning after the boy had returned..."
mo "They found his shoes neatly placed outside their front door."
s "*Quietly* Creepy..."
mo "Anyway... I know it wasn't the best story."
mo "But, I thought I'd share it, regardless."
m "I thought it was pretty spooky."
s "Where was that boy taken?"
mo "Oh?"
mo "He probably made the story up as a response to the traumatic memory."
m "Makes sense."
v "Poor kid..."
mo "Yeah, my mother always took telling that story {i}very{/i} seriously."
mo "I think she really believed it."
mo "Especially after having it told to her so many times growing up."
mo "So... Does anyone else have a story they'd like to share?"
mo "Anyone?"
nao "Okay, okay... I get it."
nao "I think I have one."
m "(This should be good.)"
nao "It's even somewhat related to your story, Dr. Eve."
nao "Mostly because it also involves a body of water in a forest."
nao "In this case, a small lake."
mo "Sounds interesting."
nao "It's actually a lake..."
nao "{i}...very{/i} close to us."
b "So, this story takes place {i}here?{/i}"
nao "Yes... It's something I saw one night."
nao "While all of you were sleeping."
b "You {i}better not{/i} have been spying on us."
b "Although, that would be kinky."
mo "Please, Belle. Let Naomi tell her story."
nao "Thank you, Dr. Eve."
nao "So, one hot night I couldn't sleep."
nao "I kept trying, and trying, but the heat was sweltering."
nao "I couldn't manage to fall asleep."
nao "So, I decided to take a short stroll to the lake."
nao "To get some fresh air."
nao "So, I put on my robe and left the cabin quietly."
nao "Walking toward the lake, I felt a cool breeze on my neck."
nao "It was refreshing... but gave me the chills."
nao "I closed my eyes, enjoyed the cool night."
nao "It was quite peaceful."
nao "As I got to the dock..."
nao "...accompanied by the sounds of the boards creaking beneath my feet..."
nao "...I noticed something toward the edge of the lake."
nao "It was..."
nao "A cloud of fireflies."
v "Wow, that's pretty."
nao "I agree, it was serene."
nao "Until the fireflies began... dancing."
m "Dancing?"
b "Yeah, what? Shakin' their booties?"
nao "*Quietly* Goddamn it."
nao "No, Belle."
nao "They were dancing, and bobbing."
nao "They began swirling around a bit, then they stopped."
nao "They just floated around in a cloud, like before."
nao "To put it simply, I was pretty weirded out by this."
nao "But, what happened next left me speechless."
nao "They formed..."
nao "The shape of a ghostly woman."
m "Creepy..."
nao "Even creepier was the way {i}she{/i} behaved."
nao "At first, it seemed like she didn't care about my presence."
nao "The vague head-shape was slightly hung."
nao "As if she was staring deep into the lake."
nao "But, as I kept watching, she lifted her head."
nao "It felt like she was watching me."
mo "*Quietly* Ooohh... That gave me goosebumps."
nao "It was all really surreal."
nao "So surreal I wondered if I may have been dreaming."
nao "As I took a step back, the board under my foot creaked loudly."
nao "Alerting the ethereal phantom I call..."
nao "{i}The Lady of the Lights.{/i}"
nao "She began drifting over toward me quickly."
nao "It freaked me out..."
nao "So, I turned and started walking away."
nao "However, I had that creepy feeling of someone breathing down my neck."
nao "I looked over my shoulder back toward the lake..."
nao "...and saw the lady at the edge of the dock."
nao "I turned and sprinted away, as anyone smart would."
nao "I made it back to the cabin in a flash..."
nao "But, as I was closing the door, quietly..."
nao "I saw her."
nao "She was at the lake shore, looking directly at me."
nao "In a panic, I closed the door and jumped into bed."
nao "Closed my eyes and forced myself to sleep."
nao "Never fully shaking the feeling that she was still watching me from the shore."
nao "She could be watching {i}any one of us{/i} as we sleep."
nao "Maybe even tonight!"
mo "Wow, Naomi. That was quite the story!"
m "Bravo, Naomi. You definitely spooked me..."
m "(She couldn't have actually seen The Lady of the Lights.)"
m "(Although... I do see a lot of fireflies around the lake late at night.)"
v "I doubt I'll be walking around the lake at night as much as I did before."
mo "Oh, don't let that dreadful tale scare you."
mo "I've been around this camp long enough to know the lady is actually quite charming."
mo "*Chuckle* If you can get beyond her rude stare."
mo "I think that's all the time I have for stories, tonight."
mo "You ladies can spend as much time here as you'd like before bed."
mo "As long as [m!t] is okay with tending to the fire."
m "I'm willing to, if you'd all like that."
b "I'd love that."
b "And, I'm guessing the other girls would, too."
nao "That would be nice."
v "Yeah, [m!t] is always welcome."
mo "Then, I guess it's decided."
mo "Goodnight, ladies."
mo "[m!ct]."
mo "Enjoy!"
b "So, now that Dr. Boring is gone..."
b "We can have some {i}real{/i} fun."
v "Belle, she's {i}not{/i} boring."
v "She's a professional."
b "A professional {i}bore.{/i}"
m "She just takes her work seriously, Belle."

b "Hmm, I don't know. Maybe my summer plans could be shifted around..."
b "For you, handsome."
