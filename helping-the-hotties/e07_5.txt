    Narr:	You're awoken from your deep nap.
    Me: 	What? Has it really time to wake up?
    Me: 	*Groan* It feels like I only slept 15 minutes...
    Narr:	Suddenly, you hear another chime from your phone.
    Me: 	What the hell?
    Me: 	It's only been 30 minutes.
    Me: 	Someone messaged me?
        Me: 	Oh.
        Me: 	(It's just an email.)
        Me: 	Ugh... (Stupid spam emails.)
        Me: 	(Why do they always come at the worst time?)
        Me: 	(Well, now that I'm awake...)
        Me: 	(What's this stupid email even advertising?)
        Me: 	(What's this?)
        Me: 	"Dear Sir."
        Me: 	(Wonderful opener.)
        Me: 	(This guy couldn't even find the name associated with my email.)
        Me: 	"Dear Sir, I am sending this post to congratulating you..."
        Me: 	(Blah, blah...)
        Me: 	"You are selected to be the receiver of the sum of $15,000,000."
        Me: 	Woah.
        Me: 	*Chuckle* Looks like I'm rich.
        Me: 	"To collect your winnings, please send us..."
        Me: 	(What info do these scammers want?)
        Me: 	"...a photocopied picture of your driver's license..."
        Me: 	(Oh, yeah?)
        Me: 	"...your Social Security Number..."
        Me: 	*Laughs out loud* Oh really? That too?
        Me: 	What else do you guys want?
        Me: 	My mother's maiden name? The name of my first pet?
        Me: 	OH! I know! How about a vial of my blood?
        Me: 	"...and a phone number we can contact you at."
        Me: 	Sure. I'll send you all that...
        Me: 	...and, you'll send me $15,000,000.
        Me: 	*Chuckle* Simple as that.
        Me: 	Aahhh... (At least I got a little laugh out of this.)
        Me: 	(It looks like I still have an hour left to get some rest.)
        Me: 	Naomi?
        Naomi:	"Hey, Dennis..."
        Naomi:	"What are you doing right now?"
        Me: 	(She sent these recently...)
        Me: 	(I should reply to her.)
        Me: 	"I was napping."
        Naomi:	"Did I wake you up?"
        Me: 	"Yeah, but I'm fine with that."
        Naomi:	"Good."
        Naomi:	"Then, we're going to have some fun."
            Naomi:	"Then, we're going to have some fun."
                Naomi:	"You suuuure you wanna know?"
                    Naomi:	"You suuuure you wanna know?"
                        Me: 	"Of course. Are you really gonna keep me waiting?"
                        Naomi:	"Maybe I will."
                            Naomi:	"Maybe I will."
                                Naomi:	"Maybe you'll end up waiting a veeery long time."
                                    Naomi:	"Maybe you'll end up waiting a veeery long time."
                                        Naomi:	"You will... if you want a surprise."
                                            Naomi:	"You will... if you want a surprise."
                                                Me: 	"A surprise? For me? How sweet of you, Naomi."
                                                Me: 	"I have a feeling I won't like this..."
                                        Naomi:	"Good boy. Now, tell me... do you want a surprise?"
                                            Naomi:	"Good boy. Now, tell me... do you want a surprise?"
                                                Me: 	"I'd love a surprise. Especially if that surprise is you."
                Naomi:	"LOL. And what if it is?"
                    Naomi:	"LOL. And what if it is?"
                        Me: 	"Then I guess I'll just have to play along. lol"
                        Naomi:	"Good, I like a man who listens... and does what he's told."
                            Naomi:	"Good, I like a man who listens... and does what he's told."
                                Me: 	"And, I like a woman who knows what she wants."
                                Naomi:	"Wooow, Dennis. Very smooth."
                                    Naomi:	"Wooow, Dennis. Very smooth."
                                        Naomi:	"That you are... So, indulge me Mr. Charming."
                                        Me: 	"In what way, little lady?"
                                        Me: 	"What? You're acting like that's a surprise to you."
                                Me: 	"That's not a surprise to me, Naomi. You've made that clear."
                        Me: 	"Then I'd rather not be a part of that kind of "fun"."
        Naomi:	Such a gentleman.
        Naomi:	"You know, Dennis..."
        Naomi:	"You're really fun."
        Me: 	"Happy to hear it. You are too, Naomi."
        Naomi:	"You really think so?"
        Me: 	"Of course. You make my days here better."
        Naomi:	"You're too sweet..."
        Naomi:	"So, let me do something sweet for you."
        Me: 	Something sweet? (Is this her surprise?)
        Me: 	(It sounds like I'm gonna like this...)
        Me: 	"Something... sweet?"
        Naomi:	"Just a sec."
        Me: 	(This better not be a prank.)
        Me: 	(What's this?)
        Me: 	Holy...
        Naomi:	"Surprise."
        Me: 	...moly.
        Me: 	"That was quite the surprise."
        Naomi:	"Did you liiiike it?"
        Me: 	"How could I not?"
        Me: 	"You're an 11/10."
        Naomi:	"Oh, stop it. You're making me blush."
        Naomi:	"So... Where's my nude?"
        Me: 	"Your nude?"
        Naomi:	"Yes. It's only polite to send a nude back."
        Naomi:	"So, where is it, sexy boy?"
        Me: 	(Send a nude back?)
        Me: 	(She's really serious about that, I'm sure.)
        Me: 	(She did make me pretty happy...)
        Me: 	(...so, maybe I should return the favor.)
            Me: 	(...so, maybe I should return the favor.)
                Me: 	(Wait a second...)
                Me: 	(Who knows who Naomi would show that pic to.)
                Me: 	(I'd be done for if any of the girls let that secret slip.)
                Me: 	(Even worse, it could be used as blackmail against me.)
                Naomi:	"Sooo..."
                Naomi:	"What's the holdup?"
                Me: 	"I really can't, Naomi."
                Naomi:	"Wow... You're really not going to follow through?"
                Naomi:	"You're really doing this?"
                Me: 	"Sorry, Naomi. I'm not gonna budge."
                Naomi:	"You really know how to kill a mood."
                Naomi:	"Hope your nap satisfies you."
                Naomi:	"I know it won't come close to how I'd satisfy you."
                Naomi:	"But, you fucked it up."
                Naomi:	"Bye, Mr. Buzzkill..."
                Me: 	Fuck it. (I'm not going to reply to that.)
                Me: 	(I should just let her cool off.)
                Narr:	Before you were able to close your messaging app.
                Narr:	You notice that Naomi deleted the nude she sent to you.
                Me: 	Damn...
                Me: 	(I messed that up.)
                Me: 	(I guess the best nudes are fleeting.)
                Me: 	(But, naps are eternal.)
                Me: 	Shit... (I guess naps aren't eternal.)
                Me: 	*Yawn* (They're only around 30 minutes long...)
                Naomi:	I wonder if he has the balls...
                Naomi:	Oh my god...
                Naomi:	No way!
                Naomi:	He really did it.
                Naomi:	Shit...
                Naomi:	(That nude I sent was pretty old.)
                Naomi:	(Now I feel kinda bad...)
                Me: 	"So, is that good enough for your refined tastes?"
                Naomi:	"Oh, it definitely is."
                Naomi:	"You've made me very happy."
                Me: 	"Glad to be of service, miss."
                Me: 	(Hope she doesn't show anyone else that pic...)
                Narr:	Your worry is interrupted by your phone ringing.
                Me: 	(Naomi's calling?)
                Me: 	Hello?
                Naomi:	Hey handsome.
                Naomi:	I'm very happy with you.
                Me: 	Oh, you are?
                Naomi:	Very... very happy.
                Naomi:	So happy... that I'll give you another surprise.
                Me: 	Two surprises in one day?
                Me: 	I don't think I can handle that much excitement.
                Naomi:	Well, you better get ready.
                        Me: 	Oh, a video call?
                        Naomi:	Yeeeesss...
                        Naomi:	Gonna keep me waiting?
                        Me: 	Of course n--
                        Naomi:	Like what you see?
                        Me: 	Damn...
                        Naomi:	What? Left you speechless?
                        Me: 	Yeah. You took my breath away.
                        Naomi:	This will probably make your heart stop, then.
                        Me: 	Wooooowww...
                        Naomi:	So...
                        Naomi:	Why don't you meet me halfway, sexy.
                        Me: 	I think my friend down here wants to say hello.
                        Naomi:	Your friend is the guest of honor.
                        Me: 	Is he?
                        Naomi:	Yes. He's a most honorable guest.
                        Naomi:	And, his presence is very pleasing.
                        Naomi:	So pleasing...
                        Naomi:	I can't help myself.
                        Me: 	Good, neither can I.
                        Naomi:	Oh... Keep talking like that.
                        Naomi:	It's so... charming.
                        Me: 	If you insist...
                        Me: 	You know what my guest of honor would do to your private chambers?
                        Naomi:	What would he do?
                        Naomi:	Ravish my curtains?
                        Naomi:	Ruffle my bedsheets?
                        Me: 	Oh, he'd do much more than that.
                        Naomi:	*Moans* And... that is?
                        Me: 	He'd act like he owns the place.
                        Me: 	He'd maybe even put his feet up on the table.
                        Naomi:	Oh, yeah?
                        Me: 	Yeah. He'd really make himself at home.
                        Naomi:	*Moans* Fuuuuuck yeah. This is your home now.
                        Naomi:	Do whatever you want.
                        Me: 	God damn it.
                        Naomi:	What is it?
                        Me: 	I wish I was with you right now.
                        Naomi:	So do I...
                        Naomi:	But... we can save that for another time.
                        Me: 	That sounds great to me.
                        Naomi:	Good. My private chambers await your presence.
                        Naomi:	But, for now, I must take my leave.
                        Naomi:	Toooodles.
                        Me: 	(That was a nice surprise.)
                        Me: 	(Naomi has really warmed up to me.)
                        Me: 	(She's not the frigid ice princess anymore.)
                        Me: 	(She still has a ways to go to become a kind and just ruler.)
                        Me: 	*Yawn* (I should take advantage of however much time I have left.)
                        Me: 	(Get a tiny bit of shut-eye.)
                        Me: 	Naomi. Naomi...
                        Naomi:	Yes?
                        Me: 	I don't think we have enough time for a video call right now.
                        Naomi:	I don't think you understand what you're missing out on.
                        Me: 	*Sigh* I have a hunch.
                        Naomi:	Oh well.
                        Naomi:	You snooze, you lose.
                        Naomi:	And, today, you lost big time.
                        Me: 	I already regret my choice.
                        Naomi:	Ah. I guess you'll just have to live with it.
                        Naomi:	For now.
                        Naomi:	Talk to ya later, Dennis.
                        Me: 	Bye, Naomi.
                        Me: 	(Shit, why did I refuse?)
                        Me: 	(I doubt I even have much time to rest anymore...)
                        Me: 	(20 minutes? Okay...)
                        Me: 	*Yawn* (Better than nothing, I guess.)
        Naomi:	*Sigh* Woooooow...
        Naomi:	"I was just trying to have some fun with you, Dennis."
        Naomi:	"But, you've shown me that you don't know how to have fun."
        Me: 	"Hey, I know how to have fun."
        Naomi:	"It doesn't seem like you do."
        Me: 	"Then you should ask some of the girls at my college."
        Naomi:	"Oh really? Now what? You want me to believe that you're some player?"
        Naomi:	"LOL. Yeah right."
        Naomi:	"Anyway, you killed the mood."
        Me: 	"Oh, I killed the mood?"
        Me: 	"Sure. Look, I wanna get back to my nap, Naomi."
        Naomi:	Ah! How dare he.
    Narr:	Somewhat surprisingly, nothing wakes you up.
    Narr:	You nap soundly, and peacefully.
    Narr:	None of the drama or troubles of Red Falls reach you in your dreams.
    Narr:	Outside, the summer heat begins to die down.
    Narr:	Eventually, a shrill noise pierces this peaceful rest.
    Me: 	Wha--
    Me: 	Noooo...
    Me: 	Ughhh...
    Me: 	*Groans* Mrrffrr...
    Me: 	No... No... Just a little more.
    Me: 	Please...
    Eve:	Dennis... Dennis...
    Eve:	Dennis, you have to wake up.
    Me: 	What? What is it?
    Eve:	Dennis, I need you to wake up.
    Me: 	Eve? What do you need my help with?
    Eve:	Nothing right now.
    Eve:	But, you will be needed soon...
    Eve:	And, you can't nap forever, Dennis.
    Me: 	Yeah, I know...
    Me: 	I'm getting up.
    Eve:	Good.
    Eve:	I have to go gather the girls.
    Eve:	See you after the session.
    Me: 	See ya, Eve.
Eve:	(It's nice that Dennis got some rest.)
Eve:	(And, that he wasn't messing around...)
Eve:	Hmm... (Hopefully he wasn't messing around.)
Eve:	(I shouldn't doubt him.)
Eve:	(Dennis is better than that...)
Eve:	Hello ladies.
Eve:	Thank you for meeting here in a timely fashion.
Eve:	How is everybody doing today?
Naomi:	I'm doing much better now, knowing that the sun will set soon.
Eve:	Yes, it has been quite hot around midday.
Eve:	But, it does seem to have cooled off a bit.
Belle:	Too bad I haven't.
Eve:	Well...
Eve:	You'll have the opportunity to do so, now.
Eve:	Anyway...
Eve:	I've gathered you all here for the second half of your session.
Eve:	Last time, you were divided into groups,
Eve:	and asked to discuss your feelings of each other.
Eve:	This session, however, will focus on the flip side of that coin.
Eve:	We will focus on your thoughts of yourselves.
Belle:	How is that a good use of our time?
Eve:	Excuse me?
Belle:	I mean, we all know what Naomi thinks of herself.
Naomi:	You bit--
Eve:	Ladies! BE QUIET!
Eve:	Thank you.
Eve:	Now, where was I...
Eve:	Ah, yes.
Eve:	We will dig deeper into your own thoughts on yourselves.
Violet:	I'm sorry for interrupting, Dr. Eve.
Violet:	But, why is this a group session?
Eve:	Great question, Violet.
Eve:	I believe it will be good for you all to speak openly about yourselves.
Eve:	However, if any of you think this is your chance to ridicule each other...
Eve:	You will be asked to leave the session immediately.
Eve:	*Unintelligible* ...leave the session immediately.
Me: 	(What's wrong?)
Me: 	(Eve's kicking someone out of the session, already?)
Me: 	*Chuckle* (Must have been Belle.)
Me: 	(This session is going to be interesting, I'm sure of it.)
Me: 	(Better get closer, so I can actually hear what happens.)
Me: 	(Behind that cabin?)
Me: 	(Seems safe enough.)
Narr:	You sneak around back quickly, and s ilently.
Narr:	Nobody is aware of your presence.
Eve:	Did I make myself clear?
Me: 	(That seems to have quieted them all down...)
Eve:	Okay, then we can begin.
Eve:	This session will act as a natural conclusion to our earlier session.
Me: 	(Last session the girls just talked about each other...)
Me: 	(Ooooh.)
Eve:	Earlier, I asked you all to share what you think of each other.
Eve:	However, this time we will discuss the opposite.
Eve:	I know this may be tough for you all.
Eve:	It can be hard to open up about such things.
Naomi:	That's easy enough.
Belle:	Yeah, I'm always honest with myself...
Belle:	Especially about what my heart desires.
Eve:	Unfortunately, that's not the direction we'll be taking.
Eve:	I want you all to speak honestly about who you are.
Eve:	It might be hard, at first, to figure out how to do this.
Eve:	But, I'm sure you'll all get the hang of it soon enough.
Stacy:	Dr. Eve?
Eve:	What is it, Stacy?
Stacy:	Can we begin with simpler things?
Stacy:	Like... Like things we enjoy?
Eve:	Well, if it isn't just the things you like...
Eve:	...and, if it helps you better understand yourselves...
Eve:	Why not?
Eve:	Go for it.
Eve:	Stacy. Would you like to begin?
Stacy:	I'd rather let someone else go first.
Stacy:	If you'll allow it, of course.
Eve:	I'm fine with that.
Eve:	Would someone else like to take the spotlight?
Narr:	The girls all sit in apprehension, hoping someone else will step in.
Eve:	Anyone?
Eve:	This is a safe space.
Belle:	*Chuckle* A safe space?
Eve:	Yes, Belle. We must all respect each other here.
Eve:	And allow everybody's voices to be heard.
Violet:	Well, okay then.
Violet:	Since nobody else is going to, I'll start.
Eve:	Thank you, Violet.
Violet:	It's no problem, Dr. Eve.
Violet:	Someone had to break the ice.
Eve:	To make this easier for you, I'll ask you a question.
Eve:	What is something you like about yourself?
Violet:	Well... I like that I take care of myself.
Eve:	Great example, Violet.
Eve:	It's a good trait, to care for oneself.
Eve:	Would you like to continue?
Violet:	Of course.
Violet:	Umm... I'd also say I value my inner strength.
Violet:	The effort I give when I commit to something.
Eve:	Very insightful, Violet. Thank you.
Eve:	Let's go around the circle, since that's easiest.
Eve:	Naomi, you're up next.
Naomi:	*Sigh* Fine, I'll comply with your request.
Naomi:	My favorite thing about myself...
Naomi:	Hmm. It would probably be my taste.
Eve:	Naomi... Please, something deeper.
Naomi:	Dr. Eve, I wasn't finished with that thought.
Eve:	Oh, my apologies. Please continue.
Naomi:	I love my taste in the arts.
Naomi:	I think that's a trait that enriches my life.
Eve:	I'm certain it does, Naomi.
Eve:	A healthy mind is curious about all sorts of stimuli.
Naomi:	Exactly how I see it.
Naomi:	There is so much in the world to sample, to enjoy.
Eve:	Those are the telltale signs of a curious mind.
Naomi:	I also value my wit.
Belle:	*Scoffs*
Eve:	Belle.
Eve:	Why don't you tell us something you value about yourself.
Belle:	My sexy body, duh.
Eve:	Belle, get serious, please.
Eve:	That's my final warning.
Belle:	Okay, okay. Sorry.
Belle:	I was just joking a little...
Belle:	To lighten the mood.
Eve:	Noted.
Belle:	Okay. My favorite trait?
Belle:	I'd say my sense of humor.
Belle:	Wouldn't you all?
Naomi:	*Chuckle* You've got some work to do.
Belle:	Thank you for your critique.
Eve:	Well, a good sense of humor is healthy.
Belle:	Exact--
Eve:	When not used as a defense mechanism.
Eve:	Can you give us another trait?
Belle:	Hmm... Well...
Belle:	I like...
Belle:	That I'm pretty good at video games.
Eve:	Oh, you are?
Belle:	Well, yeah.
Belle:	Every now and then I do speedruns on my second channel.
Violet:	What's a speedrun?
Belle:	It's where you play a game and try to beat it as quick as possible.
Violet:	Oh, that sounds cool.
Belle:	What's really cool is the way people achieve their records.
Belle:	The creative ways they break the game to get to the finish line.
Eve:	Wow, that's very fascinating, Belle.
Eve:	Thank you for opening up to us like that.
Eve:	And, teaching us all something new.
Belle:	No probs.
Eve:	Stacy, can you finish this round off for us?
Eve:	The floor is yours.
Stacy:	Okay, well...
Stacy:	I like...
Stacy:	The warm embrace of the Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus.
Eve:	That doesn't seem like a personality trait, Stacy.
Stacy:	It is.
Eve:	How?
Stacy:	Although you all think I'm some loony...
Stacy:	What I follow is more of a personal philosophy.
Stacy:	Understand?
Eve:	Well--
Stacy:	That warmth... it's not purely external.
Stacy:	It's not that my god is smiling upon me, bathing me in its warmth.
Stacy:	That warmth radiates from inside my heart.
Stacy:	I... I guess you can say I value myself.
Eve:	Hmm...
Eve:	I'm sorry if we pushed you too much, Stacy.
Eve:	But, this was very insightful.
Eve:	You are quite true to yourself.
Eve:	(What could have caused her outburst?)
Eve:	(Why was she sent here by court order?)
Eve:	(She doesn't seem like the type to do what they allege she did...)
Eve:	Well, that's it for the first round.
Eve:	Thank you all for opening yourselves up.
Eve:	I know that can be a very vulnerable place to be.
Eve:	You all did very well.
Eve:	The second round may make some of you more uncomfortable than the first round did.
Eve:	That is expected, given the topic.
Eve:	What is your least favorite trait about yourselves?
Narr:	As Eve finished that sentence, a hush fell over the group.
Eve:	Oh, don't worry.
Eve:	This is nothing to be afraid of.
Narr:	Still, despite Eve's kind reassurances, the girls were quiet.
Eve:	Someone has to be first...
Eve:	But, if it's so difficult, I can choose one of you at random.
Eve:	To keep it fair.
Eve:	Do any of you have a proposal for a different selection method?
Narr:	Silence, total silence.
Narr:	Not even a cricket could be heard chirping.
Eve:	Okay... How about...
Violet:	I guess I'll go first...
Violet:	...again.
Violet:	My least favorite trait...
Violet:	Probably... my shyness.
Violet:	But, I think I'm making good progress with that.
Naomi:	I'd have to agree.
Naomi:	You seemed like you'd never come out of your shell when we first met.
Violet:	Well, if I remember correctly, you weren't the friendliest either.
Naomi:	Yeah... You're right. I'm sorry, Violet.
Violet:	It's fine, Naomi.
Violet:	Thanks for that.
Eve:	This is wonderful.
Eve:	We're really making some progress here, ladies.
Eve:	Naomi, how about you go next?
Naomi:	Sure.
Naomi:	So...
Naomi:	Uhm...
Naomi:	I guess I can be pretty rude.
Naomi:	To the point of being cold.
Eve:	That's a fairly common defense mechanism.
Naomi:	Yeah, I know.
Eve:	Would you say you're anxious when meeting new people?
Naomi:	Maybe.
Naomi:	I never felt anxious...
Naomi:	More like I couldn't be honest with fresh faces.
Naomi:	Maybe I was afraid.
Eve:	It's okay to feel that way, Naomi.
Eve:	Being aware of it is the only way to change your behavior.
Eve:	So, it's wonderful that you are trying.
Eve:	You're doing a great job.
Naomi:	Thank you, Dr. Eve.
Naomi:	That means... a lot.
Eve:	You're all doing very well.
Eve:	Belle, please take it from here.
Belle:	Fine. I will.
Belle:	My least favorite thing about myself?
Eve:	Yes.
Belle:	I don't know...
Belle:	I don't think there's anything wrong with me.
Eve:	Everybody has flaws, Belle.
Eve:	That's not inherently negative.
Eve:	Being in denial of our flaws is, though.
Eve:	It stops us from becoming who we could be.
Belle:	Yeah, that does make sense...
Belle:	Okay, fine.
Belle:	I think I could tone-down the teasing.
Eve:	That's a good start.
Eve:	I believe people will take you more seriously,
Eve:	and enjoy your company more.
Eve:	Because, you're a nice girl.
Eve:	Despite how you sabotage yourself.
Belle:	*Sigh* Yeah... I know.
Eve:	Stacy, please finish this up for us.
Stacy:	Sure...
Stacy:	The thing I dislike the most about myself...
Stacy:	To be honest, I used to dislike myself more in the past.
Eve:	Then, you've made good progress since then.
Stacy:	Yeah... But, the big thing now is how I handle stress.
Eve:	Can you elaborate on that?
Stacy:	Sure. When I get stressed, I don't sleep that well...
Stacy:	Then my mind becomes... foggy.
Eve:	Hmm...
Eve:	I see. Does anything else happen when you get stressed?
Stacy:	I don't know. I just feel exhausted, drained.
Stacy:	Like a flickering flame about to be snuffed out.
Eve:	Thank you... Stacy.
Narr:	Eve seems concerned by Stacy's response to the question.
Narr:	However, to keep the atmosphere calm, she continues as if nothing is wrong.
Eve:	Ladies, I have to say, I'm quite proud of you all.
Eve:	You spoke openly, and honestly.
Eve:	That's one of the hardest things to do.
Eve:	Some people never manage to allow themselves to be that open.
Eve:	That's it for today.
Eve:	However, we'll start the campfire later.
Eve:	I've even decided to throw in a little surprise reward for your work today.
Belle:	Oooh, a surprise?
Eve:	Yes. Something sweet.
Eve:	For very sweet young ladies.
Violet:	Thanks, Dr. Eve.
Narr:	The girls all happily begin standing up.
Narr:	You quickly become aware that you should find a hiding spot.
Narr:	Otherwise, someone will know you spied on a very private session.
Me: 	(Okay, okay.)
Me: 	(Where to hide, where to hide...)
Narr:	You quickly look around, noticing three decent spots.
Me: 	(Okay.)
Me: 	(I can hide behind that tree trunk, behind the corner of the chopping block...)
Me: 	(Or, just stay here.)
        Me: 	(Or, just stay here.)
Me: 	(That tree trunk seems big enough to hide behind.)
Me: 	(I only need to stay here until everybody's gone.)
Me: 	(It looks like the girls are leaving...)
Me: 	(Eve's heading back to the house, too.)
Me: 	(Guess this spot was a goo--)
Emily:	Heya. Whatchu up to?
Me: 	(Shit.)
Me: 	Oh, nothing much.
Me: 	Just looking for something.
Emily:	Oh? You are?
Emily:	Not honing your skills as a spy?
Me: 	Nah. I dropped something out here earlier.
Me: 	But, I can't find it.
Me: 	Oh well.
Emily:	You suuuuure that's why you were out here?
Me: 	Mhm.
Emily:	Reeeaaaaly?
Me: 	Yep.
Emily:	Whatever you say.
Emily:	So...
Emily:	Can I tag along?
Me: 	Tag along for what?
Emily:	Whatever weird plans you've been cooking up behind this tree.
Me: 	I really don't know what you're implying...
Me: 	I told you what I was doing.
Emily:	Look, I don't care why you were hiding behind a tree trunk like a cartoon character.
Emily:	I just wanna have some fun.
Emily:	With you.
Me: 	You're really not gonna let go of this, are you?
Emily:	Hmmm...
Emily:	Nope. I'd really love to tag along.
Emily:	Come ooooon, Dennis.
Me: 	I don't know...
Me: 	Look. I wanted to talk to Stacy in private.
Me: 	She's been acting off since this morning.
Emily:	Ooohh... Since your prophecy.
Me: 	Yeah. Sure, my prophecy.
Me: 	Anyway, I want to check up on her.
Me: 	See how she's doing.
Emily:	Sounds like a real mystery.
Emily:	I'm in!
Me: 	Emily...
    Me: 	Emily...
        Emily:	Pleeeeaaase, Dennis!
        Emily:	I'm going to nag you until you let me tag along.
        Me: 	Ugh!
        Me: 	You will never let it go...
        Me: 	Fine, fine...
        Me: 	*Groan* You're so stubborn!
        Emily:	And you're no fun.
        Me: 	I'll let you join me. This one time.
        Me: 	Okay?
        Emily:	Lead the way, Sherlock!
        Me: 	Sure thing, Watson.
        Emily:	So, where is she?
        Me: 	I don't know. I doubt she's in her cabin...
        Me: 	She hasn't been "in" all day.
        Emily:	Hmm, do you think she's avoiding you?
        Me: 	I doubt it...
        Me: 	It seems like she's been avoiding everyone today.
        Emily:	Maybe she just wants some real privacy.
        Emily:	You know how hard it is to find that at camp.
        Me: 	*Chuckle* Yeah, I'm well aware of that.
        Emily:	You know, you're not so innocent yourself.
            Emily:	Or, have you remembered what knocking is?
            Me: 	Hey now... It was a force of habit.
            Me: 	At college I don't really need to knock before entering.
            Me: 	I dorm alone.
            Emily:	Excuses, excuses.
        Emily:	You sure you're not just trying to see things you shouldn't?
        Me: 	Of course not.
        Me: 	A wizard does not see things he shouldn't...
        Me: 	...merely exactly the things he should.
        Emily:	Okay Dennis The Wise.
        Emily:	What do your wizard eyes tell you about that?
        Me: 	Oh. Well...
        Me: 	My wise eyes tell me we should approach the fair maiden.
        Me: 	Hey, Stacy. What're you up to?
        Stacy:	Huh? Oh, hello.
        Stacy:	What brings you two out here?
        Emily:	Well, Dennis just wanted to say hello.
        Emily:	And, to see how you are.
        Me: 	Yeah. I haven't seen you around much all day.
        Stacy:	I'm sorry about that.
        Stacy:	I've been somewhat preoccupied.
        Me: 	It's okay, Stacy.
        Me: 	Are you okay? Is something bothering you?
        Stacy:	No, not really. Why do you ask?
            Stacy:	No, not really. Why do you ask?
                Me: 	You're not worried about that eclipse, are you?
                Stacy:	The eclipse? I don't... believe... so.
                    Stacy:	The eclipse? I don't... believe... so.
                        Me: 	Do eclipses mean something in your dogma?
                        Me: 	Nothing bad will happen, Stacy... It's just an eclipse.
                Stacy:	Eclipses...
                Stacy:	They carry significance since ancient times.
                Emily:	Yeah.
                Emily:	Back in the day they were seen as extremely bad juju.
                Me: 	How did you learn about that?
                Emily:	What can I say? I love HistoryTV.
                Me: 	(Now it makes sense why her brain is wired for conspiracy theories.)
                Stacy:	Yes. Eclipses are typically seen as omens.
                Stacy:	I believe the same.
                Me: 	What kind of omen are they to you?
                Stacy:	Omens of disorder.
                Me: 	Disorder?
                Me: 	In what way?
                Stacy:	I don't mean that society will crumble by dawn.
                Stacy:	It's more like... a time of mental dissonance.
                Stacy:	The sun is a great ball of fire.
                Emily:	Yeah... it is.
                Stacy:	Symbolically, it's the closest physical representation of the Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus' divinity.
                Stacy:	And, of its children's enlightenment.
                Me: 	Hmm, I see.
                Me: 	So, the moon blocking the sun represents a lack of that connection?
                Stacy:	Yes, precisely that. But, it also represents something else...
                Stacy:	Temporary uncertainty.
                Stacy:	Because of that disconnect between the followers and the divine.
                Stacy:	During an eclipse, and around the time of the eclipse, the divinity cannot see us.
                Stacy:	And we cannot see its guidance.
                Emily:	Wow... That's pretty deep.
                Emily:	I'll have to do some research into your mythology and symbols.
                Stacy:	Feel free to...
                Stacy:	But, approach it with an open mind.
                Emily:	Oh, my mind is open.
                Me: 	*Chuckle* Maybe even a little too open.
                Stacy:	I don't believe there's such a thing.
                Me: 	(I mean, there definitely is.)
                Me: 	(That's how people get swept-up in cults...)
                Narr:	The conversation stops for a moment, until Emily breaks the silence.
                Me: 	Did you happen to have a strange dream last night?
                Stacy:	A strange dream? Why would you suggest something so specific?
                    Stacy:	A strange dream? Why would you suggest something so specific?
                        Me: 	Well, most of us noticed that you've seemed tired all day.
                        Me: 	Whenever I saw you today, you looked distant...
                Stacy:	You've all been very perceptive.
                Stacy:	I've had a harder time falling asleep recently.
                Stacy:	And, I haven't felt as well-rested.
                Me: 	So... You haven't been sleeping well...
                Me: 	Have you been having bad dreams?
                Stacy:	I'm uncertain...
                Stacy:	My mind is full of soot and smoke at the moment...
                Stacy:	*Whispers* Sometimes... I feel like I'm trapped in a dream.
                Me: 	What do you mean by that?
                Stacy:	Life is... strange.
                Emily:	It really is sometimes.
                Emily:	Maybe... Maybe dreams are meant to anchor reality?
                Me: 	In what way, Em?
                Emily:	Well, if dreams are surreal, then life remains normal.
                Stacy:	Hmm. Quite an interesting theory...
                Emily:	What do you think dreams mean?
                Stacy:	I believe they're symbolic.
                Emily:	Oooh, symbolic? Of what?
                Stacy:	Well, many things.
                Stacy:	It depends what symbols you see in the dream.
                Me: 	Well, what would the sky being red symbolize?
                Stacy:	How red?
                Me: 	Uhh... A deep crimson.
                Stacy:	Crimson... That...
                Stacy:	That's an omen.
                Emily:	Why is that?
                Stacy:	Were the color brighter, it would have been a positive sign.
                Stacy:	But, crimson is different...
                Stacy:	It's dark, and deep. It's the color of blood.
                Me: 	I don't think it's that big of a deal, Stacy...
                Me: 	No need to worry about me.
                Stacy:	If you insist...
                Stacy:	What other significant imagery did you see?
                Me: 	An eclipse, and a silhouetted person.
                Me: 	(I'd rather not tell her who that person was.)
                Stacy:	I see.
                Stacy:	Your dream was fraught with omens.
                Emily:	I wonder if someone cast a spell on him.
                Me: 	I hope not.
                Emily:	What about that rich witch, Naomi?
                Me: 	*Laughs* I doubt she knows any spells.
                Me: 	She's also the furthest thing from a witch.
                Stacy:	Maybe someone's jealousy manifested your nightmare.
                Me: 	Again, I really doubt that.
                Me: 	It's most likely stress.
                Stacy:	Perhaps...
                Narr:	The conversation stops for a moment, until Emily breaks the silence.
        Emily:	Well, thanks for your time, Stacy.
        Emily:	I liked the topic of this conversation.
        Emily:	Real esoteric.
        Stacy:	You're welcome.
        Stacy:	I'd be happy to talk with you about such things any time.
        Emily:	I'll definitely take you up on that offer.
        Emily:	But, I gotta go for now.
        Me: 	Where are you going?
        Emily:	I'm staff, too, ya know?
        Emily:	I'd bet Kiara is getting tired of waiting for me back at the house.
        Emily:	Bye Stacy!
        Emily:	Thanks, Dennis. I'm glad you let me join.
        Me: 	No problem, Em.
        Me: 	See ya soon.
        Me: 	Stacy, are you really okay?
        Stacy:	Yes, I am.
        Stacy:	Why is everybody pestering me about that?
        Me: 	Well, I think people are just a little worried about you.
        Stacy:	Sure, sure. They mock me and my beliefs, yet they care for me?
        Me: 	Look, maybe they just didn't know how to take the information, at first.
        Me: 	But, I know that they care about you.
        Me: 	I also do.
        Me: 	We all want you to be okay.
        Stacy:	I... I don't know what to believe.
        Stacy:	I trust you, but not all of them.
        Stacy:	The only one of them who is kind to me, and doesn't use me, is Violet.
        Me: 	She's the best adjusted of them.
        Me: 	You know that, Stacy.
        Stacy:	That is true...
        Stacy:	Thank you, Dennis.
        Stacy:	I appreciate the warmth of your kindness.
        Stacy:	But, I have to go.
        Me: 	It's okay, Stacy.
        Me: 	I'm here for you if you need me.
        Stacy:	I'll keep that in mind.
        Stacy:	Goodbye, ashen prince.
        Me: 	Bye, Stacy.
        Me: 	(What was all of that about?)
        Me: 	(She really thinks those things about the eclipse?)
        Me: 	"Temporary uncertainty..."
        Me: 	(It's just strange.)
        Me: 	(But, it gives me some idea as to her current mental state.)
        Me: 	(So... She's feeling very uncertain.)
        Me: 	(And, that's causing her to be distanced?)
        Me: 	Hmm... (Very likely.)
        Me: 	(I might want to bring that up to her whenever I see her.)
        Me: 	(I'm sure I'll run into her.)
        Me: 	(Probably sooner than later...)
        Me: 	You can't come with me, Em.
        Emily:	Why not?
        Me: 	Because I want Stacy to open up and tell us what's bothering her so much...
        Me: 	...and she won't do that with you around.
        Emily:	I'm a good listener.
        Me: 	It's not about that. She won't let strangers in.
        Emily:	And you're not a stranger to her?
        Me: 	I talked to her more than you did.
        Emily:	I wonder why.
        Me: 	Stop it with that...
        Me: 	Hey, what if I promise to tell you afterwards what I found out?
        Emily:	Hmm...
        Me: 	C'mon. It's fair and square.
        Me: 	You can be my Watson.
        Emily:	Fine! That's a fair deal.
        Me: 	Go now. I'll find you later.
        Emily:	Ooookaay!
        Emily:	Byeee!
        Me: 	Now, where is she?
        Me: 	(She could be in her cabin...)
        Me: 	No luck...
        Me: 	Hmm...
        Me: 	Wait a second.
        Narr:	You spot someone sitting under a tree across the lake.
        Me: 	(Who's that?)
        Me: 	(Oh, perfect.)
        Me: 	(Stacy's sitting over there under that tree.)
Me: 	(I'd argue this is the best spot.)
Me: 	(The more I move, the easier it would be to spot me.)
Narr:	Suddenly, the sound of a cracking twig pierces the silence.
Narr:	You freeze behind that cabin, like a deer in headlights.
Me: 	(What was tha--)
Naomi:	Pssst.
Naomi:	Dennis. What the hell are you doing?
Me: 	Oh, nothing. I was just walking around.
Naomi:	I don't believe you.
Naomi:	Especially since I know what you mean by "walking around."
Me: 	Hey, now...
Me: 	I was actually taking a walk...
Me: 	So, I don't know what more to tell you.
Me: 	Believe what you want.
Naomi:	My god, what kind of bug is in your butt?
Naomi:	I'm just teasing you.
Naomi:	Like I truly care what you spend your time doing.
Me: 	Oh. Well, tease away.
Naomi:	*Chuckle* Watch out, I might just take you up on that.
Me: 	Go ahead.
Naomi:	Okay, sure.
Naomi:	You must love it when hot girls tease you.
Naomi:	That must be your kink.
Me: 	Psht. Of course not.
Naomi:	*Laughs* Sure, I believe you.
Me: 	What're you laughing at?
Naomi:	I just had a funny thought...
Me: 	What was it?
    Naomi:	Oh, it's just...
    Naomi:	I thought of an offer I'd like to make with you.
    Me: 	What kind of offer?
    Naomi:	An offer no sane man would refuse.
    Me: 	Who said I was a sane man?
    Naomi:	*Giggle* Wait, were you originally a patient here?
    Me: 	*Chuckle* Who knows?
    Me: 	Wanna find out?
    Naomi:	Hey... You're taking my thunder.
    Naomi:	I'm the one who's supposed to invite you to come find out.
    Me: 	Find out what?
    Naomi:	Well... Why don't you follow me to find out?
    Me: 	(Did she just pull the ol' switcheroo on me?)
    Me: 	(She is pretty witty.)
    Me: 	(And, pretty pretty.)
    Naomi:	Did your brain freeze-up from that 180 I pulled on ya?
    Me: 	*Chuckle* How'd you know?
    Naomi:	I could see it written all over your face.
    Me: 	Well, you did 180 my 180...
    Naomi:	That I did.
    Naomi:	So, why don't you follow me, handsome?
        Naomi:	So, why don't you follow me, handsome?
            Me: 	You know what?
            Naomi:	What?
            Me: 	I will take you up on that offer.
            Me: 	I've got some time before someone comes looking for me.
            Naomi:	Wonderful.
            Me: 	The dock?
            Naomi:	Yeah, it's such a nice afternoon.
            Naomi:	We finally get a break.
            Me: 	Yeah, I have been sweating my balls off.
            Naomi:	*Chuckle* Dennis!
            Me: 	Whoops! Sorry.
            Me: 	I forgot I shouldn't speak like a peasant in your presence.
            Naomi:	Quite right.
            Naomi:	Anyway, won't you sit with me for a little while?
            Me: 	You won't pull any of Belle's shenanigans?
            Naomi:	I promise not to push you into the water...
            Naomi:	...as an excuse suck your dick.
            Me: 	*Chuckles* You really got Belle's style down to a T.
            Naomi:	What can I say?
            Naomi:	I'm very observant.
            Me: 	Well, it is in your nature, as a writer.
            Naomi:	Oh, quit flattering me.
            Naomi:	You'll make me blush.
            Me: 	Ah. What a beautiful scene.
            Naomi:	I agree.
            Me: 	Oh, you do, now?
            Me: 	Even with all the dirt around?
            Naomi:	Well, the dirt still sucks.
            Naomi:	But, I have grown kind of fond of the lake.
            Me: 	Oh, have you?
            Naomi:	Yes. It's a beautiful little scene.
            Naomi:	So peaceful, especially in the evening.
            Me: 	Glad you're all starting to realize that.
            Me: 	Especially you.
            Naomi:	Hey, now. I do like vacation, okay?
            Naomi:	And, I have been camping before.
            Me: 	Oh, you have?
            Naomi:	Yes! I have.
            Me: 	Where?
            Naomi:	Oh, to Yosemite, Yellowstone, The Poconos.
            Me: 	Wow, you've really been around.
            Naomi:	From coast to coast.
            Me: 	And, how would you rank the scenery around here?
            Naomi:	Hmmm...
            Naomi:	7... or 8, out of 10.
            Me: 	Very nice.
            Naomi:	Maybe that rating will increase as this place grows on me.
            Me: 	We can only hope.
                Naomi:	Say, Dennis...
                Me: 	Yeah?
                Naomi:	I really did appreciate that you let me keep my phone.
                Me: 	Oh, no problem.
                Me: 	I have to be honest, though...
                Me: 	I wasn't sure if I made the right choice or not.
                Naomi:	Oh, really?
                Me: 	But, now I'm sure I did.
                Naomi:	Good save.
                Me: 	*Chuckle* Well, I wasn't finished.
                Me: 	I was going to say that anyway.
                Naomi:	I don't doubt you.
                Me: 	Happy to hear it.
                Naomi:	Ah, I wish I could stay here longer...
                Me: 	Oh, you have to go?
                Naomi:	Yeah, I'd maybe like to change before evening.
                Naomi:	Knowing Dr. Eve, I could get whisked away at any moment for some surprise session.
                Naomi:	So, we'll see how that goes.
                Me: 	Oh? What are you going to change into?
                Me: 	Something sexy, like a nice pair of sweatpants?
                Naomi:	Heavens no.
                Me: 	*Chuckle* I was just joking.
                Me: 	I know you'd rather die.
                Naomi:	*Laughs* You almost had me there for a second.
                Naomi:	Hey, Dennis.
                Me: 	Yeah?
                Naomi:	Make sure to keep your phone close to you tonight.
                Me: 	Will do. (What is she planning?)
                Me: 	Bye, Naomi. Enjoy.
                Me: 	(I should get going.)
                Me: 	(So much happened today.)
                Me: 	(That weird dream seems so far away.)
                Me: 	(And, Stacy...)
                Me: 	Hmm...
                Naomi:	It would have if you let me keep my phone.
                Me: 	Sorry about that, Naomi...
                Naomi:	Oh, are you?
                Me: 	Of course.
                Me: 	Why the hell would I care if you have your phone or not?
                Me: 	It was just my job, okay?
                Naomi:	I know, I know...
                Naomi:	I'm just teasing you for what could have been.
                Me: 	No need to rub salt in the wound...
                Naomi:	Hmmm...
                Me: 	You know, we could do this the old-fashioned way.
                Me: 	Do what the old fashioned way?
                Naomi:	Okay, hear me out.
                Naomi:	Meet me at the campground, tonight.
                Me: 	(Oh, that's what she meant by old-fashioned.)
                Me: 	Sure. I'll come find you.
                Naomi:	Perfect.
                Me: 	(If I remember.)
                Naomi:	Ah, I wish I could stay here longer...
                Me: 	Oh, you have to go?
                Naomi:	Yeah, I'd like to change before evening.
                Naomi:	Into something more comfortable.
                Me: 	Oh? Some sweatpants?
                Naomi:	Heavens no.
                Naomi:	You'll just have to wait and see.
                Me: 	Oh, will I?
                Me: 	I'm looking forward to it.
                Naomi:	Hey, Dennis.
                Me: 	Yeah?
                Naomi:	Make sure to keep your phone close to you tonight.
                Me: 	Will do. (What is she planning?)
                Me: 	Bye, Naomi. Enjoy.
                Naomi:	You too.
                Me: 	Ah. (The sun is setting soon.)
                Me: 	(I should get going.)
                Me: 	(So much happened today.)
                Me: 	(That weird dream seems so far away.)
                Me: 	(And, Stacy...)
                Me: 	Hmm...
            Me: 	I don't think I have time to take you up on that offer, unfortunately.
            Naomi:	Oh, what a shame.
            Naomi:	I guess I'll have to find something else to do.
            Me: 	Sorry to let you down.
            Naomi:	Oh, it's no big deal.
            Naomi:	You let yourself down more than me.
            Naomi:	Enjoy whatever it is you have to do.
            Me: 	Knowing how mundane my tasks usually are...
            Me: 	I doubt I'll enjoy it too much.
            Naomi:	That does sound more boring than what we could have done.
            Naomi:	That can wait, though. Right?
            Me: 	Ah, guess so.
            Naomi:	Bye, now.
            Me: 	Bye, Naomi. See you later.
            Me: 	(Wrong choice?)
            Me: 	(Ah, who knows.)
            Me: 	(Mainly, I'm concerned with Stacy...)
            Me: 	(What should I do with her?)
    Naomi:	Wouldn't you like to know?
    Me: 	I would, actually.
    Naomi:	Ah, I'm afraid I can't do that.
    Naomi:	Unfortunately.
    Me: 	Really?
    Me: 	You're really going to leave me wondering?
    Naomi:	I am...
    Naomi:	For now.
    Naomi:	Don't stress yourself out about it.
    Naomi:	We don't want you getting any premature gray hairs.
    Me: 	Yeah, I'd rather not look like a dad at age 30.
    Naomi:	*Giggle* But, you have to admit...
    Naomi:	You'd probably be a gray fox.
    Me: 	Ah, who knows.
    Me: 	Only time will tell.
    Naomi:	Speaking of time...
    Naomi:	I think it's time I head back to my cabin.
    Naomi:	I want to change into something more comfortable.
    Naomi:	And, relax a little before someone comes looking for us.
    Me: 	Yeah, that someone would probably be me.
    Naomi:	If I'm lucky, it will be.
    Naomi:	Ciao!
    Me: 	See you later.
    Me: 	(I wonder what she means by comfortable.)
    Me: 	*Chuckle* (Probably not basketball shorts and a sweatshirt.)
    Me: 	(That's for sure.)
    Me: 	(What was I doing before Naomi interrupted me?)
    Me: 	Hmm...
    Me: 	(Ah, right! Stacy...)
    Me: 	(What should I do with her?)
Me: 	(Near the chopping block seems fine.)
Me: 	(And, if I hear anyone coming, I can just start chopping.)
Me: 	(It would give me a legit reason to be there.)
Narr:	Completely confident in your plan, you walk over to the chopping block.
Me: 	Hmm...
Me: 	Might as well.
Me: 	Hmppph.
Me: 	Ah, I still got it.
Narr:	As you line your next log up to be chopped, someone rounds the corner.
Eve:	Wow, that was quite the clean cut, Dennis.
Me: 	Oh. Hey, Eve.
Me: 	Didn't notice you there.
Eve:	Makes sense. It looks like you've been busy.
Me: 	Yep. I thought I could lend a hand during my free time.
Eve:	That's very kind of you, Dennis.
Eve:	Would you care to take a walk?
Me: 	Is something wrong?
Eve:	Not at all.
Eve:	I'd just like some company on my evening walk.
Eve:	And, you look like you could use a bit of a break.
Me: 	That I could.
Me: 	So, why not?
Eve:	Wonderful.
Eve:	I'll lead the way.
Eve:	So, have you had a good day?
Me: 	I have.
Me: 	I feel like I've finally settled in.
Eve:	That's wonderful.
Me: 	How are you doing, Eve?
Eve:	I'm doing well, Dennis.
Eve:	Thank you for asking.
Me: 	Uhh, where are we going?
Eve:	Oh, my usual afternoon route.
Eve:	A nice, easy walk around the shore.
Me: 	Ah. That sounds nice.
Eve:	Oh, it is quite nice.
Eve:	I see shooting stars quite regularly.
Me: 	That's awesome.
Me: 	I've only seen a few since I got here.
Eve:	Maybe you'll see some more tonight.
Me: 	Yeah, hopefully...
Me: 	So, what did you want to talk about?
Eve:	Well, what would you like to talk about?
Me: 	Oh, I don't know.
Me: 	How about...
    Me: 	How about...
        Me: 	I think I'd rather talk about college.
        Eve:	Well, then, how are things at college?
        Eve:	Having fun?
        Me: 	It's okay, I guess. Some subjects are really boring.
        Me: 	Math is giving me a massive headache.
        Eve:	Welcome to the club... I hated it, even in high school.
        Me: 	You, hating school? I don't believe it.
        Eve:	*Chuckles* It's true.
        Eve:	I even cheated on a test or two.
        Me: 	No way!
        Me: 	I knew it! I knew you weren't such goody-two-shoes.
        Eve:	We all carry secrets.
        Me: 	I'm all ears.
        Eve:	That's a conversation for some other time.
        Eve:	Are you seeing anyone?
        Me: 	I was, but we broke it off.
        Eve:	Oh, I'm so sorry, Dennis.
        Eve:	How are you feeling?
        Me: 	I'm okay. I mean, I'm a bit sad.
        Me: 	I like Jane, but there's a lot of things happening in my life right now.
        Me: 	I can't give her what she needs and deserves. I don't think it's fair to her.
        Eve:	You're very mature about it. I'm glad you're considering her feelings in such a way.
        Eve:	It's very commendable.
        Eve:	You never told me what kind of girls you fancy.
        Me: 	I don't have a type, per se. Not when it comes to looks, anyway.
        Eve:	So personality comes first?
        Me: 	Well, yeah. Shouldn't it?
        Eve:	Of course.
        Eve:	Having a pretty face doesn't hurt, though.
        Me: 	Dr. Eve!
        Me: 	So you are like the rest of us.
        Eve:	You would be surprised.
        Eve:	Back to my question, what should the girl of your dreams have then?
        Me: 	Humor, for sure. Intelligence. Playfulness.
        Eve:	The magical trio. I like it.
        Me: 	Good luck to me.
        Eve:	What? You don't think that's easy to find?
        Me: 	Not really. The hookup culture is taking over. Makes finding someone special that much harder.
        Eve:	There's no shame in casually hanging out with more girls.
        Eve:	How would you know what you like and need if you don't experiment?
        Me: 	Oh, so you're condoning one night stands?
        Eve:	I didn't say that. The most important thing is to be respectful and considerate.
        Me: 	I try to be.
        Eve:	Good. I never doubted it.
        Eve:	Oh, would you look at that.
        Me: 	Hmm?
        Eve:	The sun is already setting.
        Eve:	There's something I need to go prepare.
        Eve:	I'll see you soon, Dennis.
        Me: 	Oh. See you later, Eve.
        Me: 	I'd rather talk about camp.
        Eve:	So, are you enjoying your time here?
        Me: 	I wouldn't say enjoy, but I'm warming up to it.
        Eve:	Emily missed you quite a bit, you know.
        Me: 	Yeah, she's been pestering me to hang out with her more.
        Eve:	She looks up to you. Of course she wants to hang out more.
        Me: 	I would if Mrs. Counselor gave me more free time.
        Eve:	We can work something out. You've been working hard and deserve some time off.
        Me: 	Thanks.
        Eve:	What do you think of the girls?
        Me: 	They're... interesting.
        Eve:	Oh? In what way?
        Me: 	(Is she fishing for information or...?)
        Me: 	Just in general. They are all unique, and very different from each other.
        Me: 	They bicker a lot, but I think they're growing on each other.
        Eve:	Very perceptive of you, Dennis.
        Eve:	Ah yes, team spirit is something we want to focus on more.
        Eve:	Bonding is a very powerful element in therapy.
        Me: 	It is?
        Eve:	Of course. Sharing the same experience and emotions makes the patients more appreciative of...
        Eve:	...what therapy has to offer them.
        Me: 	Do you think everyone will be successful?
        Eve:	That depends on a lot of factors. Therapy is just a starting point.
        Eve:	Self-motivation is crucial to this process.
        Me: 	What do you mean? Like, they need to want it?
        Eve:	Yes. If they believe they don't need help, the chances are, therapy won't have the same effect.
        Me: 	I see... So for some it's hopeless?
        Eve:	I wouldn't say that, no. It just means we can't have the same approach for everyone.
        Eve:	It's all about fine-tuning it.
        Me: 	It sounds exhausting.
        Eve:	At times. But that's the beauty of it.
        Eve:	It's rewarding for the patients, as well as the therapist.
        Eve:	Have you ever considered being a therapist?
        Me: 	Hmm, it has crossed my mind...
        Eve:	Think about it. You've got talent.
        Me: 	I'll consider it.
        Eve:	Wonderful.
        Eve:	There's something I need to go prepare.
        Eve:	I'll see you soon, Dennis.
        Me: 	Oh. See you later, Eve.
Narr:	Standing at the campground, you collect your thoughts...
Narr:	Remembering Stacy's demeanor over the day.
Me: 	*Exhale* (I should go check on her.)
Me: 	(She might actually open up to me, unlike everyone else.)
Me: 	(And, worst case scenario, she doesn't want to talk.)
Me: 	Ah, well. (Better get to it.)
Narr:	As you're about to turn back...
Narr:	You spot someone sitting on a bench across the lake.
Me: 	(Stacy?)
Me: 	(Oh, perfect.)
Me: 	(It is Stacy.)
Me: 	Hey, Stacy.
Stacy:	Oh, hello.
Stacy:	What brings you beneath my tree?
Me: 	Looking for kindling?
Stacy:	Oh, don't get my hopes up like that.
Stacy:	Why are you really here?
Me: 	Well, to be honest...
Me: 	I wanted to see how you're doing.
Me: 	How you've been.
Stacy:	Oh, well... I'm fine.
Me: 	Are you, really?
Stacy:	Yes. I'm fine, despite what you all may think.
Me: 	Stacy, I'm not judging you...
Me: 	I just wanted to make sure you're okay.
Me: 	Because I like you. You're my friend.
Stacy:	Oh...
Stacy:	My ashen prince...
Me: 	And, to be honest, you look like you're freaked out by something.
Me: 	Something I think I might also be feeling.
Stacy:	What exactly do you mean by that, Dennis?
Me: 	I mean...
Narr:	A sudden pang of doubt stops you.
Me: 	(Since this morning it's as if her flame has faded.)
Me: 	(She probably would appreciate some sympathy and understanding...
Me: 	(Wait, wait...)
Me: 	(Couldn't what I say freak her out more, though?)
Narr:	You notice Stacy's eyebrows ruffle up, curious of your silence.
Me: 	(She's getting curious what I'm thinking.)
Me: 	(I need to answer her quickly.)
    Me: 	(I need to answer her quickly.)
        Me: 	To be honest, Stacy...
        Me: 	I had a strange dream last night.
        Stacy:	Oh? To what did it pertain?
        Me: 	(I probably shouldn't go into too much detail.)
        Me: 	Well, it was about an eclipse...
        Me: 	I think.
        Stacy:	That's quite... ominous.
        Me: 	Why do you say that?
        Stacy:	Well, eclipses are symbolic.
        Me: 	Of what, exactly?
        Stacy:	Eclipses are typically seen as omens.
        Stacy:	I believe the same.
        Me: 	What kind of omen are they to you?
        Stacy:	Omens of disorder.
        Me: 	Disorder?
        Me: 	In what way?
        Stacy:	I don't mean that society will crumble by dawn.
        Stacy:	It's more like... a time of mental dissonance.
        Stacy:	The sun is a great ball of fire.
        Stacy:	Symbolically, it's the closest physical representation of the Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus' divinity.
        Me: 	I see...
        Me: 	So, it being obscured by the darkness is symbolic of that uncertainty.
        Stacy:	Yes. Exactly.
        Stacy:	But, enough of my esotericism.
        Stacy:	Please tell me more of your dream.
        Me: 	I mean, there isn't much more to tell.
        Narr:	Stacy looks at you with a distrustful curiosity.
        Stacy:	Are you certain?
        Me: 	I mean, the rest of the things happening were typical things in dreams.
        Me: 	My technology didn't work.
        Me: 	I couldn't determine the time.
        Stacy:	Oh, a timeless place?
        Me: 	Yeah. Dreams do exist in some kind of gap.
        Stacy:	Between the world of flame and the world of ash.
        Me: 	Yeah... I guess they do. A weird place of limbo.
        Me: 	In the dream, my door was also stuck for a while.
        Me: 	I was trapped in my room.
        Me: 	So, in a sense, it became limbo to me.
        Me: 	Until it wasn't, and my door opened directly outside.
        Stacy:	Odd...
        Me: 	Yeah, it was a bit disorienting.
        Stacy:	Then what happened?
        Me: 	Then I saw a shadow...
        Me: 	It ran off into the woods.
        Me: 	And, I followed.
        Stacy:	A shadow...
        Me: 	I lost it, in the woods. 
        Me: 	Then everything got dark, and I woke up.
        Stacy:	Thank you for sharing that with me, ashen prince.
        Me: 	It's fine, Stacy.
        Me: 	Now... How are you, honestly?
        Stacy:	Truthfully, I'm... feeling a bit strange.
        Me: 	Do you want to talk about it?
        Stacy:	I can't quite put it to words.
        Stacy:	The feeling... escapes me.
        Stacy:	But...
        Stacy:	Hmm...
        Stacy:	Come with me.
        Me: 	(I don't think telling her is the best idea.)
        Me: 	Well, you know...
        Me: 	That feeling of not sleeping very well.
        Stacy:	You think that's... causing this?
        Me: 	I'm not sure, but it's my best guess.
        Me: 	When I don't get a good night's sleep, I feel like a zombie.
        Stacy:	I don't feel like a zombie...
        Me: 	I don't mean literally.
        Me: 	Just... confused. Low energy.
        Stacy:	Dennis.
        Stacy:	My flame is flickering strangely...
        Stacy:	I feel it.
            Me: 	Does that have anything to do with those drawings you made?
            Stacy:	Drawings?
            Me: 	(Think of a way to rationalize this...)
            Me: 	Yeah.
            Me: 	Those drawings on your nightstand and under your pillow.
            Me: 	Earlier today I had to do an inspection of the cabins...
            Stacy:	Inspection?
            Me: 	Yeah, just to see if they're holding up well.
            Stacy:	Oh.
            Me: 	And, while I was in there I noticed your side of the cabin was in disarray.
            Stacy:	I apologize for that...
            Me: 	Stacy, it's fine.
            Me: 	Those drawings, though.
            Stacy:	I honestly don't remember drawing anything last night.
            Me: 	Really?
            Me: 	Not even this one?
            Narr:	A look of genuine befuddlement appears on Stacy's face.
            Stacy:	N-No... I don't recognize that.
            Stacy:	You think I drew that?
            Me: 	I mean, I did find it on your side of the room.
            Stacy:	Well, I don't remember drawing that.
            Stacy:	Strange... though.
            Me: 	What?
            Stacy:	It appears to be an eclipse.
            Me: 	Why do you think that's strange?
            Me: 	There's an eclipse happening tomorrow.
            Stacy:	Really?
            Me: 	Yeah, I found out this morning.
            Me: 	(After my coincidental dream...)
            Stacy:	Eclipses... are omens.
            Stacy:	A beast of darkness, suppressing the divine flame.
            Me: 	Only for a little while.
            Stacy:	But... during that time, we are in the dark.
            Me: 	Yeah, because of the Moon's shadow.
            Stacy:	No, no... It's about our souls.
            Stacy:	The divine flame is obscured, as is our path.
            Me: 	You don't need to worry about that, Stacy...
            Me: 	We're here for you.
            Me: 	So you don't feel confused, or lost.
            Stacy:	I...
            Stacy:	Hmm...
            Stacy:	Come with me.
            Me: 	(This sounds like what's been bothering her.)
            Me: 	What do you mean by flickering?
            Stacy:	Back and forth. Caught in the wind...
            Me: 	So, you're having a hard time concentrating?
            Stacy:	It's not nearly that simple...
            Me: 	No?
            Stacy:	I feel...
            Stacy:	As if my mind is clouded by smoke.
            Me: 	Maybe you just need some sleep?
            Stacy:	Maybe...
            Stacy:	I'm afraid, too.
            Me: 	Of what?
            Stacy:	Of being lost.
            Me: 	You don't need to worry about that, Stacy...
            Me: 	We're here for you.
            Me: 	So you don't feel confused, or lost.
            Stacy:	I...
            Stacy:	Hmm...
            Stacy:	Come with me.
Narr:	Stacy grabs you by the hand, leading you away.
Narr:	You notice that she seems... different.
Me: 	Where are we--
Stacy:	Ssshhh... Allow the sparks of emotion guide us.
Me: 	(I'd like to see where she's taking me.)
Me: 	Lead the way.
Stacy:	*Quietly* Ash beneath our feet...
Me: 	Hmm?
Stacy:	*Quietly* Guide our sparks to the heavens...
Me: 	What was that?
Stacy:	Oh, nothing.
Stacy:	A wish.
Me: 	For what?
Stacy:	Ssshhh...
Me: 	Got the message.
Stacy:	*Quietly* Into the embrace of the divine flame.
Me: 	(Is that some kind of mantra?)
Me: 	(It sounds like she's wishing for protection.)
Me: 	(Must be related to how she's feeling...)
Stacy:	We have arrived.
Me: 	Where are we?
Me: 	Is this...
Stacy:	Recognize this place?
Me: 	Yeah, I think so.
Me: 	This is where I found you smokin' "da uurb."
Stacy:	Your memory serves you well.
Me: 	Did you bring me out here for another joint?
Me: 	*Quietly* I have no clue how you managed to hide the first one...
Stacy:	Hmm?
Me: 	Oh, nothing.
Stacy:	Dennis...
Me: 	What is it, Stacy?
Stacy:	Now is not the time for words...
Stacy:	It is the time for flow.
Me: 	Flow?
Stacy:	Just follow my movement, and my guidance.
Narr:	Stacy seems oddly confident, despite her behavioral fluctuations.
Me: 	(What is all this?)
Stacy:	Come...
Me: 	How's thi--
Stacy:	You're still graced by warmth...
Stacy:	Will you share your grace?
Me: 	Of course.
Stacy:	Aahh, yes.
Narr:	As her lips meet yours, you feel a new kind of passion from Stacy.
Me: 	Wow...
Me: 	That was--
Stacy:	Surprising?
Me: 	Amazing.
Stacy:	My embers crave your flame.
Me: 	(Woah, she's really letting loose.)
Stacy:	Oh, your touch...
Stacy:	Its warmth charms me.
Me: 	Stacy...
Me: 	(This feels amazing.)
Stacy:	Yes?
Me: 	This is... unreal.
Stacy:	I'm the envoy of your dreams.
Me: 	Yeah, you really are.
Me: 	(But... Goddamn it. Something seems weird.)
Me: 	Stacy, do you really wanna do this?
Stacy:	Right now, I want this more than anything.
Me: 	(Hmm... Should I really let this continue?)
        Me: 	Stacy, I...
        Stacy:	Ssshh... Here.
        Stacy:	Touch me.
        Me: 	But, Stacy...
        Stacy:	*Moan* Aaahh...
        Stacy:	Yes?
        Me: 	I don't think--
        Stacy:	Shhh... Thinking separates us.
        Stacy:	As do these...
        Narr:	Stacy's erotic grinding, combined with the sight of her bare ass...
        Narr:	Has somehow made your rock-hard boner even harder.
        Me: 	(Holy shit.)
        Stacy:	Won't you join me?
        Me: 	No, Stacy... No!
        Me: 	This isn't like you...
        Me: 	This isn't right.
        Stacy:	What... What ever could you mean?
        Me: 	Stacy, I like this...
        Me: 	Like, really like this...
        Me: 	But, I think we should wait...
        Me: 	Until you're acting like yourself again.
        Stacy:	I am... myself...
        Stacy:	Unless...
        Me: 	So do I, Stacy.
        Stacy:	Ah... Yes.
        Stacy:	Touch me more.
        Me: 	Like this?
        Stacy:	*Moan* Aaahh...
        Stacy:	Yes...
        Stacy:	But, something separates us...
        Narr:	Stacy's erotic grinding, combined with the sight of her bare ass...
        Narr:	Has somehow made your rock-hard boner even harder.
        Me: 	(Holy shit.)
        Stacy:	Won't you join me?
        Me: 	Say no more.
        Stacy:	The warmth of your divine rod...
        Stacy:	...lights my fire.
        Me: 	Ooohh yeah.
        Me: 	You're creating some magical friction, Stacy...
        Me: 	I think it's lighting my fire, too.
        Stacy:	Ooohh...
        Stacy:	Mmmm...
        Stacy:	*Moan* Yeeeess... Give it to me!
        Me: 	Fuuuu--
        Stacy:	Hnng. Yeeesss...
        Stacy:	Ooooh yes...
        Stacy:	How about this?
        Stacy:	Yees... yeeees.
        Me: 	Stacy...
        Me: 	Fuuuuu...
        Stacy:	*Moans* I'm... going... crazy!
        Me: 	Your pussy... is... driving me wild!
        Stacy:	Aaahhhh!
        Me: 	*Moans* So... good...
        Narr:	Stacy closes her eyes and falls limp into your arms...
        Narr:	...in a state of bliss.
        Narr:	Her body twitches ever so slightly, as she opens her eyes once more.
Stacy:	What...
Stacy:	*Quietly* What have we done?
Me: 	Huh?
Stacy:	What... What have I done?
Me: 	Nothing, Stacy...
Me: 	You haven't done anything.
Me: 	What's wrong?
Narr:	You realize Stacy looks somewhat disoriented.
Narr:	Suddenly, that look of disorientation shifts to a look of embarrassment.
Stacy:	I-I must go.
Me: 	Stacy, wait!
Narr:	Before you can even think to stop her, she runs off.
Me: 	(Shit. She's gone.)
Narr:	You stand there for a moment, caught in the surprise of Stacy's sudden departure.
Me: 	(Did I scare her off?)
Me: 	(Or, was it something else?)
Me: 	(I should probably just keep my eye on her from a distance.)
Narr:	Everything that has happened throughout the day involving Stacy...
Narr:	...just brings back that feeling you awoke with, this morning.
Me: 	(There's that feeling again...)
Me: 	Ah... (I better get going.)
Me: 	(I'm sure there are things to do.)
Me: 	(Hopefully they can keep my mind off this weird feeling.)
    Me: 	(It was kinda fun doing this with Emily...)
    Me: 	(So much sneaking around, though...)
    Me: 	(I wouldn't mind leaving that kind of stuff behind...)
    Me: 	(What's going on? She was never this wild...)
    Me: 	(I can't believe I actually turned a woman down for sex...)
    Me: 	(Especially a woman like Stacy.)
    Me: 	(But, what was all that about?)
    Me: 	(She got really serious, all of a sudden.)
    Me: 	(She even looked... surprised.)
    Me: 	(That was... insanely hot.)
    Me: 	(I'd love to do that again, sometime.)
    Me: 	(Especially with a woman like Stacy.)
    Me: 	(But, what was all that about?)
    Me: 	(She got really serious, all of a sudden.)
    Me: 	(She even looked... surprised.)
Me: 	Oh, look who it is.
Me: 	Eve, right on time.
Me: 	As usual.
Me: 	(What's that on her arm?)
Me: 	(And, what's she holding?)
Me: 	(A picnic basket?)
Eve:	Dennis! Perfect.
Eve:	I was just looking for you.
Me: 	Oh! Really?
Me: 	How exciting!
Eve:	That was believable.
Me: 	Shoot. What do you need?
Eve:	I have an announcement to make. Come with me.
Me: 	Oooh, what announcement?
Eve:	You'll see.
Me: 	Come on! Tell me!
Eve:	Don't be like Emily...
Eve:	Ladies!
Eve:	If I could have a moment, please!
Eve:	Tomorrow an eclipse is happening.
Eve:	Since this will be a great opportunity for all of us to...
Eve:	...enjoy the wonders nature has to offer, we'll make an evening out of it.
Eve:	To enjoy each others company, and build team spirit.
Stacy:	*Very quietly* Why celebrate something... like that?
Belle:	I'll be right by your side, Dr. Eve.
Belle:	I can't wait to spend more time with you.
Eve:	Belle, this is a group event...
Eve:	There won't be any individual sessions.
Belle:	Too bad.
Naomi:	Do we need to bring anything?
Eve:	Just your good attitude, Naomi.
Naomi:	You're in luck, then.
Violet:	I'm looking forward to it, Dr. Eve.
Eve:	That's wonderful to hear.
Eve:	You're all in for quite a treat.
Eve:	Come, sit.
Eve:	Right over here, ladies.
Eve:	You too, Dennis.
Me: 	My pleasure.
Eve:	Oh. But, would you please start the fire for us, first?
Me: 	It would be an honor.
Eve:	So, ladies...
Eve:	How have you all been since we last saw each other?
Belle:	I've been very good...
Belle:	Thanks for asking.
Eve:	Good to hear, Belle...
Violet:	I'm doing well.
Naomi:	As am I.
Eve:	The heat didn't bother you too much?
Naomi:	It wasn't that awful.
Violet:	Yeah, there was a really nice breeze throughout the day.
Naomi:	It was quite refreshing. Very much needed.
Eve:	Ah, that's excellent.
Eve:	As is that fire.
Eve:	Well done, Dennis.
Me: 	Thanks, Dr. Eve.
Eve:	Excellent.
Eve:	Now that the fire is burning nicely, and Dennis has joined us...
Eve:	We can begin.
Narr:	Eve pauses for a moment, allowing the group to bask in the fire's warm glow.
Narr:	The fire crackles and pops, releasing a shower of sparks.
Eve:	*Chuckle* You really could cut the tension with a knife.
Eve:	I was thinking we could share some campfire stories.
Eve:	To make it easier for you all, I'll break the ice.
Eve:	Hmm...
Eve:	Okay, I think I've picked a good one.
Eve:	This is a story my mother told me when I was young.
Eve:	On dark, foggy nights.
Eve:	But, I have to warn you all...
Eve:	It's preeeetty spooky.
Naomi:	Ooooh. Now you've gotten my attention.
Me: 	Mine as well.
Me: 	I don't think I've heard this one.
Eve:	Oh, no. You haven't heard this one yet, Dennis.
Me: 	Nice. Then, please indulge us.
Eve:	So...
Eve:	When my mother was young she grew up in a small town deep in the Adirondacks.
Eve:	It was a quaint little town, and everybody knew each other well.
Eve:	Heck, they even left their doors unlocked.
Eve:	That's how trusting of each other they all were.
Belle:	I wish people still did that...
Belle:	Things would be much more fun.
Eve:	And much more dangerous, Belle.
Eve:	These days naivety isn't virtuous, it's foolish.
Eve:	And, the town? Today, it's nothing more than a ghost town.
Eve:	You probably couldn't even find it maps, anymore.
Eve:	Anyway... My mother once told me of a story from that town.
Eve:	The story of the Disappearing Fog.
Eve:	So, the area the town was built in was always known to be strange.
Eve:	Even when the first settlers got there, they knew that something was off.
Eve:	Especially the pond nearby.
Eve:	Over by the pond, it was always silent.
Eve:	Not a chirp could be heard, and no animals could be found there.
Eve:	They avoided that place, for some unknown reason.
Eve:	However, the settlers told a tale.
Eve:	A tale passed down, generation to generation...
Eve:	To protect themselves from the unknowns that existed out there.
Eve:	I doubt it's little more than a folk tale to scare children away from a dangerous pond.
Eve:	However, a tiny part of me believes the story.
Eve:	So... Long ago, the settlers' children used to roam the woods for fun.
Eve:	That is... until they began disappearing.
Eve:	Some kids that went into the woods never returned.
Violet:	Disappearing? The settlers never found them?
Eve:	Yes... mostly.
Eve:	The one case that really shook the townsfolk was the child who returned.
Eve:	One day this little boy went into the woods, but didn't return by sundown.
Eve:	All the men from the town went out to look for him...
Eve:	...as they did with all the others that disappeared.
Eve:	The search party spent days looking for him...
Eve:	...to no avail.
Eve:	However, weeks later, a trapper went out to check his fur traps...
Eve:	...and found the little boy.
Eve:	He was disoriented and confused...
Eve:	The trapper asked him where he had been, and that his parents were worried sick.
Eve:	And, the boy told the trapper everything he could remember.
Eve:	That he had wandered close to that pond, and a fog had bubbled up from it...
Eve:	...and spread quickly.
Eve:	The boy even believed that it was following him.
Eve:	As if it were alive.
Eve:	While running from the fog, he eventually tripped.
Eve:	And the fog swallowed him whole.
    Narr:	You start drifting away, wondering what could have happened...
Naomi:	What happened to him?
Eve:	When asked by his parents,
Eve:	the child could only remember being taken to a place like a dream.
Eve:	As every second went by, he remembered less and less of that dream-like place.
Eve:	But, the one thing that was truly strange to the search party was how clean he was.
Eve:	Especially considering he had been missing almost two weeks.
Eve:	Another thing they found strange was that he was missing his shoes and socks.
Eve:	From that point on, the people called the fog the Disappearing Fog.
Eve:	It was blamed for all the children who had disappeared over the years.
Eve:	But, I believe that was just their way to rationalize it.
Belle:	Rationalize what?
Eve:	To rationalize that the children were most likely eaten by predatory animals.
Naomi:	That's grim...
Eve:	Sadly, that's how most of these old folk tales started.
Eve:	There is one truly strange thing about my mother's story.
Me: 	What?
Eve:	Well, she said that the morning after the boy had returned...
Eve:	They found his shoes neatly placed outside their front door.
Stacy:	*Quietly* Creepy...
Eve:	Anyway... I know it wasn't the best story.
Eve:	But, I thought I'd share it, regardless.
Me: 	I thought it was pretty spooky.
Stacy:	Where was that boy taken?
Eve:	Oh?
Eve:	He probably made the story up as a response to the traumatic memory.
Me: 	Makes sense.
Violet:	Poor kid...
Eve:	Yeah, my mother always took telling that story very seriously.
Eve:	I think she really believed it.
Eve:	Especially after having it told to her so many times growing up.
Eve:	So... Does anyone else have a story they'd like to share?
Eve:	Anyone?
Naomi:	Okay, okay... I get it.
Naomi:	I think I have one.
Me: 	(This should be good.)
Naomi:	It's even somewhat related to your story, Dr. Eve.
Naomi:	Mostly because it also involves a body of water in a forest.
Naomi:	In this case, a small lake.
Eve:	Sounds interesting.
Naomi:	It's actually a lake...
Naomi:	...very close to us.
Belle:	So, this story takes place here?
Naomi:	Yes... It's something I saw one night.
Naomi:	While all of you were sleeping.
Belle:	You better not have been spying on us.
Belle:	Although, that would be kinky.
Eve:	Please, Belle. Let Naomi tell her story.
Naomi:	Thank you, Dr. Eve.
Naomi:	So, one hot night I couldn't sleep.
Naomi:	I kept trying, and trying, but the heat was sweltering.
Naomi:	I couldn't manage to fall asleep.
Naomi:	So, I decided to take a short stroll to the lake.
Naomi:	To get some fresh air.
Naomi:	So, I put on my robe and left the cabin quietly.
Naomi:	Walking toward the lake, I felt a cool breeze on my neck.
Naomi:	It was refreshing... but gave me the chills.
Naomi:	I closed my eyes, enjoyed the cool night.
Naomi:	It was quite peaceful.
Naomi:	As I got to the dock...
Naomi:	...accompanied by the sounds of the boards creaking beneath my feet...
Naomi:	...I noticed something toward the edge of the lake.
Naomi:	It was...
Naomi:	A cloud of fireflies.
Violet:	Wow, that's pretty.
Naomi:	I agree, it was serene.
Naomi:	Until the fireflies began... dancing.
Me: 	Dancing?
Belle:	Yeah, what? Shakin' their booties?
Naomi:	*Quietly* Goddamn it.
Naomi:	No, Belle.
Naomi:	They were dancing, and bobbing.
Naomi:	They began swirling around a bit, then they stopped.
Naomi:	They just floated around in a cloud, like before.
Naomi:	To put it simply, I was pretty weirded out by this.
Naomi:	But, what happened next left me speechless.
Naomi:	They formed...
Naomi:	The shape of a ghostly woman.
Me: 	Creepy...
Naomi:	Even creepier was the way she behaved.
Naomi:	At first, it seemed like she didn't care about my presence.
Naomi:	The vague head-shape was slightly hung.
Naomi:	As if she was staring deep into the lake.
Naomi:	But, as I kept watching, she lifted her head.
Naomi:	It felt like she was watching me.
Eve:	*Quietly* Ooohh... That gave me goosebumps.
Naomi:	It was all really surreal.
Naomi:	So surreal I wondered if I may have been dreaming.
Naomi:	As I took a step back, the board under my foot creaked loudly.
Naomi:	Alerting the ethereal phantom I call...
Naomi:	The Lady of the Lights.
Naomi:	She began drifting over toward me quickly.
Naomi:	It freaked me out...
Naomi:	So, I turned and started walking away.
Naomi:	However, I had that creepy feeling of someone breathing down my neck.
Naomi:	I looked over my shoulder back toward the lake...
Naomi:	...and saw the lady at the edge of the dock.
Naomi:	I turned and sprinted away, as anyone smart would.
Naomi:	I made it back to the cabin in a flash...
Naomi:	But, as I was closing the door, quietly...
Naomi:	I saw her.
Naomi:	She was at the lake shore, looking directly at me.
Naomi:	In a panic, I closed the door and jumped into bed.
Naomi:	Closed my eyes and forced myself to sleep.
Naomi:	Never fully shaking the feeling that she was still watching me from the shore.
Naomi:	She could be watching any one of us as we sleep.
Naomi:	Maybe even tonight!
Eve:	Wow, Naomi. That was quite the story!
Me: 	Bravo, Naomi. You definitely spooked me...
Me: 	(She couldn't have actually seen The Lady of the Lights.)
Me: 	(Although... I do see a lot of fireflies around the lake late at night.)
Violet:	I doubt I'll be walking around the lake at night as much as I did before.
Eve:	Oh, don't let that dreadful tale scare you.
Eve:	I've been around this camp long enough to know the lady is actually quite charming.
Eve:	*Chuckle* If you can get beyond her rude stare.
Eve:	I think that's all the time I have for stories, tonight.
Eve:	You ladies can spend as much time here as you'd like before bed.
Eve:	As long as Dennis is okay with tending to the fire.
Me: 	I'm willing to, if you'd all like that.
Belle:	I'd love that.
Belle:	And, I'm guessing the other girls would, too.
Naomi:	That would be nice.
Violet:	Yeah, Dennis is always welcome.
Eve:	Then, I guess it's decided.
Eve:	Goodnight, ladies.
Eve:	Dennis.
Eve:	Enjoy!
Belle:	So, now that Dr. Boring is gone...
Belle:	We can have some real fun.
Violet:	Belle, she's not boring.
Violet:	She's a professional.
Belle:	A professional bore.
Me: 	She just takes her work seriously, Belle.
Me: 	As you should take being here seriously...
Me: 	Or, did you want to stay here all summer long?
Belle:	Hmm, I don't know. Maybe my summer plans could be shifted around...
Belle:	For you, handsome.
Naomi:	Oh, quit being such a slut, Belle.
Naomi:	It's getting really annoying.
Belle:	Wow, someone's panties are in a bunch.
Naomi:	Not at all. You're just really repetitive.
Naomi:	Like an annoying song on repeat.
Belle:	*Gasps* You bitch!
Belle:	I know I'm not an annoying song!
Belle:	I'm a platinum hit!
Stacy:	SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Stacy:	SHUT UP!
Stacy:	I CAN'T TAKE THIS BICKERING ANYMORE!
Me: 	Stacy--
Stacy:	No, NO! I'm so tired of this.
Stacy:	Of them.
Violet:	Let's all just calm down. Especially you two.
Naomi:	Yeah... I'm sorry, Stacy.
Stacy:	It's... fine.
Stacy:	I think... I just need some quiet. And, some rest.
Stacy:	Good night.
Narr:	The others say good night back to Stacy, but she didn't wait to hear it.
Narr:	Within a moment she disappears into the darkness beyond the light of the campfire.
Me: 	Well, shit.
Belle:	I guess... I got a little carried away.
Belle:	Look, I'll talk to her once I get back to the cabin.
Belle:	And, if she's awake.
Belle:	But, for now, I think we should give the girl her space.
Naomi:	Agreed.
Narr:	You and the girls chit-chat for a while longer.
Narr:	However, despite the nice conversation...
Narr:	You can tell Naomi and Belle feel somewhat guilty.
Narr:	Eventually, the fire burns down enough to be put out.
Me: 	Looks like we're out of logs.
Me: 	What do you girls want to do?
Violet:	I think I'm going to hit the hay.
Belle:	I should also go check on Stacy.
Naomi:	That would be a good idea...
Me: 	I'll clean up here, then.
Me: 	It's been a fun night.
Violet:	That it has.
Narr:	The girls leave, wishing you a good night.
Narr:	Belle looks back at you with a not-so-subtle look of seduction.
Me: 	(That's so subtle...)
Narr:	In the distance, you notice that Naomi hasn't gone to sleep.
Narr:	Instead, she's sitting on her cabin's steps, looking at the stars.
Me: 	(It would be pretty nice to join Naomi for a little bit.)
    Me: 	(It would be pretty nice to join Naomi for a little bit.)
        Narr:	You consider taking Belle up on her "invitation."
        Me: 	(Let's see where this leads me...)
        Me: 	(It really is a wonderful night out...)
        Me: 	You decided to bring some romance into this?
        Belle:	What's romance?
        Belle:	I hear skinny-dipping is good for your skin.
        Me: 	I haven't heard that one.
        Belle:	Then, it's a good thing I told you. 
        Belle:	Now we can do this more often.
        Narr:	Belle's body, bathed in starlight, takes your breath away.
        Narr:	Without word, she gracefully enters the lake.
        Belle:	Are you coming?
            Belle:	Are you coming?
                Me: 	Yep.
                Belle:	That's nice to hear.
                Narr:	Embracing yourself, you jump in and swim your way toward Belle.
                Me: 	*Shivers* It's a bit colder than I expected.
                Belle:	Some exercise might warm you up.
                Me: 	What, synchronized swimming?
                Belle:	It needs to be synchronized, but it isn't swimming.
                Me: 	Wait, what are you doing?
                Belle:	Just follow your curiosity to me.
                Narr:	Belle swims away from you, keeping a bit of distance.
                Narr:	It's clear to you that she's flirting.
                Narr:	Now, all you can do is obey your curiosity, and see where it takes you.
                Me: 	*Quietly* So...
                Me: 	Why did you lead me here?
                Me: 	Are you a siren? Or, a mermaid?
                Belle:	You know I'm a mermaid.
                Me: 	What are you doing?
                Belle:	Ssshh...
                Me: 	Someone might see us, Belle.
                Belle:	Just enjoy it...
                Me: 	How... could I not?
                Narr:	You gaze deeply into her eyes as she touches you.
                Narr:	As seconds pass, you lose yourself more and more in her eyes.
                Narr:	Unconsciously, your bodies come closer together...
                Narr:	Soon enough, your lips meet with hers.
                Belle:	This feels really nice.
                Me: 	Yeah it does...
                Me: 	Your touch is electric.
                Me: 	Let me electrify you, too...
                Narr:	You pull Belle closer to you as your fingers find your way to her clit.
                Belle:	Mmm...
                Belle:	Just how I like it.
                Me: 	How about this?
                Belle:	Ahhh...
                Narr:	Smoothly, you rub Belle's clit in a circular motion.
                Belle:	I like that you can be so sweet and gentle with me.
                Me: 	Well, you deserve it.
                Belle:	Do I deserve your huuuge dick?
                Me: 	Do you?
                Belle:	Mhm.
                Narr:	She puts her legs around you...
                Narr:	...as she rubs her vagina on your hard-on.
                Me: 	Oooh. Mmm.
                Belle:	Mmm, I love riding your cock, Dennis.
                Me: 	I love this too...
                Me: 	Don't stop.
                Belle:	*Moans*
                Me: 	*Grunts*
                Belle:	Fuck!
                Me: 	This is amazing...
                Belle:	Ahhhh, yeeees!
                Belle:	Gaaaaah.
                Belle:	*Moans hard*
                Me: 	I'm close...
                Belle:	AAaah...
                Me: 	Fu--
                Me: 	I'm--
                Narr:	You cum with Belle, lying on the lake shore.
                Narr:	You can still feel her warm pussy near your twitching cock.
                Belle:	That was nice, sexy boy.
                Me: 	Mmm.
                Me: 	I'd better go now.
                Me: 	I don't want to risk anyone seeing us like this.
                Belle:	What's life without some risk?
                Me: 	I know--
                Belle:	But, you can go.
                Belle:	I wouldn't want to be the reason you get fired.
                Belle:	I'd miss these moments.
                Me: 	To be honest...
                Me: 	I would too, Belle.
                Narr:	Belle smiles a kind, genuine smile back at you.
                Belle:	Sleep tight!
                Me: 	You, too!
                Narr:	After such a nice ending of your evening, you make your way towards the house.
                Me: 	I hate to say this, but I'll have to pass.
                Me: 	I'm sure we'd have fun, but we're too close to the cabins for comfort.
                Me: 	Someone might see us, and then all hell would break lose.
                Belle:	Why do you have to spoil everything?
                Belle:	Go, then.
                Belle:	I'll enjoy this refreshing lake all by myself.
                Me: 	You're so sweet. I knew you'd understand.
                Me: 	Be careful! Bye!
        Narr:	Naomi's focus on the night sky is broken by you walking over to her.
        Narr:	However, she looks pleased by your arrival.
        Naomi:	Hey, Dennis.
        Me: 	Enjoying the stars?
        Naomi:	I am.
        Me: 	Can I join you for a little bit?
        Naomi:	Hmmm...
        Naomi:	You know what?
        Me: 	What...
        Naomi:	I'm not against it.
        Me: 	Great.
            Naomi:	Ah...
            Naomi:	It's so nice out.
            Me: 	Yeah, and I hope it stays that way.
            Naomi:	What do you mean?
            Me: 	I just hope The Lady of the Lights doesn't stare me down...
            Me: 	...or come over here to drag me to the bottom of the lake.
            Naomi:	*Giggle* Oh, come on...
            Me: 	I'm joking. I'm joking...
            Me: 	I don't believe that story.
            Naomi:	You sure?
            Me: 	*Chuckle* Yeah, especially after learning the truth about Hector.
            Naomi:	Well, that's a shame.
            Naomi:	I'm sure your scared face is cute.
            Me: 	I can neither confirm nor deny that.
            Narr:	You and Naomi sit there, watching the stars for a little while.
            Naomi:	Oh!
            Me: 	What?
            Naomi:	I just saw a shooting star.
            Me: 	Oh, cool.
            Me: 	There's another one!
            Naomi:	What did you wish for?
            Me: 	Well...
            Me: 	If I told you, it wouldn't come true.
            Naomi:	Ah, yes. You're right.
            Me: 	Okay, do you really want to know?
            Naomi:	I would like that...
            Naomi:	But, I don't want to ruin your wish.
            Me: 	Well... to be honest...
            Me: 	I don't really believe in that anyway.
            Me: 	So, I'm fine saying it.
            Naomi:	Indulge me.
            Me: 	I wish for us to get closer.
            Narr:	Your sweet words make Naomi blush.
            Naomi:	You really wished for that?
            Me: 	Mhm.
            Me: 	But, supposedly, now it won't come true.
            Naomi:	Then, let me make your wish come true.
            Narr:	You both share a brief, but passionate kiss.
            Narr:	The backdrop of stars makes the kiss especially romantic.
            Naomi:	Hey, Dennis?
            Me: 	Yeah?
            Naomi:	Can I take a pic of us?
            Me: 	Sure, Naomi.
            Me: 	That would actually be a really nice memory.
            Naomi:	Great.
            Naomi:	There. Oh...
            Me: 	What? Is something wrong with the pic?
            Naomi:	No. It's actually really... nice.
            Naomi:	I think this will be one of my all time faves.
            Me: 	Oh, yeah?
            Naomi:	I'm pretty confident about it.
            Me: 	*Yawn* I'm also pretty confident I should go back to the house...
            Naomi:	Aww... really?
            Me: 	Yeah, I should see if anyone is up...
            Me: 	Looking for me.
            Naomi:	Well, that's quite a shame.
            Naomi:	But, I have a feeling tonight will be a good night.
            Me: 	Given how nice this was...
            Me: 	It will be.
            Naomi:	Maybe the shooting stars will help us with that.
            Me: 	Only time will tell.
            Me: 	Night, Naomi.
            Naomi:	Night night.
            Naomi:	Ah...
            Naomi:	It's so nice out.
            Me: 	Yeah, and I hope it stays that way.
            Naomi:	What do you mean?
            Me: 	I just hope The Lady of the Lights doesn't stare me down...
            Me: 	...or come over here to drag me to the bottom of the lake.
            Naomi:	*Giggle* Oh, come on...
            Me: 	I'm joking. I'm joking...
            Me: 	I don't believe that story.
            Naomi:	You sure?
            Me: 	*Chuckle* Yeah, especially after learning the truth about Hector.

            Me: 	Yeah?
            Naomi:	Do you have your phone on you?
            Me: 	Unfortunately not.
            Naomi:	That's a shame...
            Naomi:	I wanted us to take a pic together...
            Me: 	Ah, shit...
            Me: 	That actually would have been a really nice memory.
            Naomi:	Yeah, it would have.
            Me: 	Hmm...
            Me: 	Wait a second.
            Me: 	I might just have something...
            Naomi:	Oh? You have a camera?
            Me: 	Something like that...
            Naomi:	Oh.
            Me: 	What? Is something wrong with the pic?
            Naomi:	Well, yeah. It's not real.
            Naomi:	*Quietly* Doofus...
            Me: 	Well, then. I'll keep it for myself.
            Naomi:	*Sigh* No, no...
            Me: 	Hmm?
            Naomi:	Please, can I see it?
            Naomi:	Wow... that is a nice one.
            Naomi:	You know what?
            Naomi:	I think this will be one of my all time faves.
            Me: 	Oh, yeah?
            Naomi:	I'm pretty confident about it.
            Me: 	*Yawn* I'm also pretty confident I should go back to the house...
            Naomi:	Aww... really?
            Me: 	Yeah, I should see if anyone is up...
            Me: 	Looking for me.
            Naomi:	Well, that's quite a shame.
            Naomi:	But, I have a feeling tonight will be a good night.
            Me: 	Given how nice this was...
            Me: 	It will be.
            Naomi:	Maybe the shooting stars will help us with that.
            Me: 	Only time will tell.
            Me: 	Oh. I nearly forgot.
            Naomi:	Hmm?
            Me: 	You wanna keep the pic?
            Naomi:	Sure, I'd love to keep it.
            Me: 	Don't lose it, now.
            Naomi:	*Chuckle* I won't.
            Me: 	Good. I'm sure it'll be a great memory.
            Me: 	Night, Naomi.
            Naomi:	Night night.
            Naomi:	*Quietly* You cute doofus...
        Me: 	(This was an eventful day...)
        Me: 	(Good ol' bed, my tired ass is coming for you.)
Narr:	It took you no time at all to get back to the house.
Narr:	And, after realizing everybody else was asleep...
Narr:	You, too, decided it was best to head up to your room.
Me: 	*Exhale* (I'm pooped.)
Me: 	(Although...)
Me: 	(I could play a round of League of Luminaries.)
Me: 	Hmm...
    Narr:	You sit at your laptop, contemplating what to do.
    Narr:	When, suddenly...
    Me: 	What the--
    Me: 	Are those...?
    Me: 	Violet?
    Violet:	Hey!
    Me: 	What are you doing here?
    Violet:	Would you like to take a walk with me?
    Me: 	Now?
    Violet:	Yes, it's really nice outside.
        Violet:	Yes, it's really nice outside.
            Me: 	Give me a second!
            Narr:	Being careful to not make any sounds, you make your way down the stairs.
            Me: 	If anyone saw me talking to you this late...
            Violet:	Everyone is asleep, don't worry.
            Me: 	Lead the way!
            Me: 	To what do I owe this pleasure?
            Violet:	I just wanted to spend some time with you.
            Violet:	We haven't hung out much today.
            Me: 	I know, I'm sorry. It was a busy day.
            Violet:	Oh, I know. Don't worry about it.
            Violet:	I know how much work you have every day.
            Me: 	Yeah, but it's not as bad as it seems, honestly.
            Me: 	I've gotten pretty used to the load by now.
            Violet:	That's good to hear.
            Me: 	Are you having a good time here?
            Me: 	I mean, when you're not in a session?
            Violet:	Of course! This place really is like a mini-vacation.
            Me: 	Ah, that's good to hear.
            Me: 	I was hoping Eve made it comfortable for you.
            Violet:	Oh yes, she has. She's quite a wonderful lady.
            Me: 	Yeah, and a pretty good boss in all honesty.
            Me: 	Hmm?
            Me: 	The usual spot?
            Violet:	I'm a creature of habit.
            Violet:	I feel the most comfortable here.
                Me: 	I'm really fond of the dock, too.
                Me: 	The quiet burble of water, reflection of stars on its clear blue surface...
                Me: 	It brings out this sense of serenity in me.
                Me: 	I can come here and reflect on things.
                Violet:	I'm glad someone appreciates this place the same as me.
                Violet:	It has helped me cope with everything that has been going on lately.
                Violet:	It's soothed my body and mind.
                Violet:	Speaking of which...
                Violet:	Is Naomi treating you well?
                Me: 	Huh?
                Violet:	I noticed you two have been spending a lot of time together.
                Violet:	Do you like her?
                Me: 	(Where is this coming from?)
                Me: 	(I was really careful not to be seen with--)
                Me: 	(Unless she--)
                Me: 	(No way!)
                Me: 	(Naomi assured me Violet sleeps like a "hibernating bear.")
                Me: 	(Those were her exact words.)
                Me: 	(Fuck me.)
                Me: 	(Just act casual.)
                Me: 	She's a sweet girl.
                Me: 	Same as everyone else here.
                Me: 	I know you're not her biggest fan, but...
                Violet:	Just sweet? Nothing else?
                Me: 	(There's no way I'm getting out of this.)
                Me: 	(She obviously knows something.)
                Me: 	Look, Violet, I--
                Violet:	Thought you could fuck everyone around here without anyone noticing?
                Me: 	I haven't been--
                Violet:	Look me in the eyes and tell me you haven't been doing that.
                Me: 	(I should just confess.)
                Me: 	(Maybe she'll go easy on me.)
                Me: 	(Or I'll accidentally drown in this lake.)
                Me: 	*Nervously sweating* I have.
                Me: 	I tried hard not to, though.
                Me: 	It isn't professional of me, to say the least.
                Me: 	Borderline creepy, more like it.
                Me: 	I didn't expect you all to be so--
                Violet:	Human? Normal?
                Violet:	What?
                Me: 	Well, yes...
                Me: 	I have to admit, I was very judgmental in the beginning.
                Me: 	I thought you were all the same.
                Me: 	In a bad way.
                Me: 	But the more time I spent hanging out with you guys, the more I started to realize...
                Me: 	...you are fragile human beings needing love and affection.
                Me: 	Same as me.
                Me: 	Since we're all stuck here together, I figured we could make the best out of it.
                Violet:	I have to admit, I was furious when I saw you with Naomi.
                Violet:	When I heard her moans, my blood started to boil.
                Violet:	I wanted to report you.
                Violet:	Make your life a living hell.
                Violet:	Which would in turn get me into trouble.
                Violet:	Because I haven't exactly been a saint, either.
                Violet:	And I don't plan on changing that anytime soon.
                Me: 	Oh?
                Violet:	You've helped me come back out of my shell.
                Violet:	Be more open, and spontaneous.
                Violet:	I've been contemplating this over and over, and it's always led me to the same conclusion.
                Violet:	I want you.
                Violet:	Your mind, and your body.
                Violet:	If that means sharing you with others, so be it.
                Me: 	Wow, Violet, I didn't expect this.
                Me: 	At all.
                Me: 	I thought I'd end up at the bottom of this lake.
                Violet:	That did cross my mind.
                Me: 	Thank you then for being considerate and sparing my life.
                Violet:	You're very welcome.
                Violet:	But if I catch you having sex with Naomi while I'm sleeping in the same cabin again...
                Violet:	...I'll roast you on a spit.
                Me: 	*Gulp*
                Violet:	Anyway...
                Violet:	The stars are wonderful, aren't they?
                Me: 	Very. I haven't done much stargazing, but seeing this...
                Me: 	It should definitely be on my everyday list.
                Violet:	I don't want to just stargaze...
                Me: 	What else did you have in mind?
                Narr:	Your words are immediately met with Violet's soft lips.
                Narr:	You surrender yourself to her gentleness while starlight reflects on the lake's surface.
                Narr:	You place your tongue on Violet's neck and trace it along her silky skin.
                Violet:	Mmm, keep going, Dennis.
                Violet:	This feels nice.
                Narr:	As your tongue returns to meet hers, your hand involuntarily moves down to Violet's ass.
                Narr:	As you caress her, you feel Violet's lust for you grow stronger.
                Narr:	Your hand naturally slides across her skin, from her round ass to her perfectly smooth thighs.
                Narr:	Suddenly, Violet pushes you onto the dock.
                Violet:	Is this how you like it?
                Me: 	It's certainly a treat...
                Narr:	Violet moans as she grinds you forcefully.
                Narr:	You wonder what got into her, but you're not complaining.
                Narr:	As she leans forward, your hands go over her shirt...
                Narr:	...and you start massaging her erect nipples, making Violet's moans louder.
                Narr:	Her perfectly round tits look incredible as they bounce up and down.
                Violet:	Why do you still have your clothes on?
                Narr:	Violet helps you take your shorts off.
                Narr:	Displaying your fully erect penis.
                Violet:	Mmm...
                Narr:	You watch her take her own shorts off and stare at her mindlessly.
                Me: 	I like how determined you are.
                Narr:	Her pussy feels amazing on your tip.
                Narr:	You're dying to put your dick inside her, but this time, Violet's in control.
                Narr:	And you have no complaints at all.
                Violet:	I want you to pleasure me.
                Me: 	It would be my utmost pleasure.
                Narr:	As she sits on your face...
                Narr:	...you comply with her wishes and your tongue starts circling Violet's wet opening...
                Narr:	...and enters inside.
                Violet:	*Moans* Aah!
                Violet:	Oh, Dennis!
                Me: 	*Grunts*
                Violet:	Gaaah!
                Narr:	Violet's pussy is really wet as you easily slide your tongue in and out.
                Narr:	She starts grinding your tongue harder, wanting more of you.
                Narr:	Her moans fill in the space around you.
                Violet:	I don't want you to feel left out.
                Violet:	I want you to cum with me.
                Narr:	Violet starts to gently jerk you off, taking your focus from everything else.
                Me: 	*Grunts* Mmm, fuck!
                Violet:	*Moans harder*
                Me: 	This is--
                Violet:	Oooohhh!
                Me: 	Aaaah, Violet. This is mind-blowing!
                Narr:	Just as your body start tensing from all the pleasure, you feel her tongue around your tip...
                Narr:	...followed by her swallowing your cock whole. 
                Me: 	Oh, Violet!
                Narr:	Her bold move catches you by surprise a bit, but you give in to the feeling.
                Violet:	*MMpfh* *Slurp*
                Me: 	Aaah!
                Narr:	Focusing all the remaining attention to pleasuring Violet, you thoroughly explore her pussy with your tongue.
                Violet:	I'm close, Dennis...
                Me: 	*Grunts*
                Me: 	Me too.
                Violet:	Mmm, this--
                Violet:	Aaaaah, I'm--
                Narr:	With her hand around your cock, you shoot your load into the air...
                Narr:	...as Violet's pussy constricts around your tongue.
                Narr:	She collapses onto you, and you both enjoy this moment of closeness.
                Violet:	That was actually--
                Me: 	Exhilarating?
                Violet:	Breathtaking, yes.
                Me: 	I was a bit surprised, to be honest with you.
                Violet:	Really? Why?
                Me: 	I didn't expect you to be so forward.
                Violet:	Is that a bad thing?
                Me: 	No! That was pretty hot.
                Me: 	Have you got any other hidden talents?
                Violet:	*Smirk* You'll find out soon enough.
                Narr:	It's become more dark as night is settling in.
                Narr:	You sit next to each other, appreciating the growing closeness between you.
                Me: 	I'm really fond of the dock, too.
                Me: 	The quiet burble of water, reflection of stars on its clear blue surface...
                Me: 	It brings out this sense of serenity in me.
                Me: 	I can come here and reflect on things.
                Violet:	I'm glad someone appreciates this place the same as me.
                Violet:	It has helped me cope with everything that has been going on lately.
                Violet:	It's soothed my body and mind.
                Me: 	Has something been bothering you?
                Violet:	Apart from the reasons I'm here?
                Me: 	Yeah.
                Violet:	It has.
                Violet:	I've been contemplating this over and over, and it's always led me to the same conclusion.
                Violet:	I want you.
                Violet:	Your mind, and your body.
                Violet:	My heart yearns for you.
                Me: 	Oh wow, Violet.
                Me: 	I like how direct you've become.
                Me: 	It really suits you.
                Violet:	Do you really think so?
                Me: 	Of course.
                Me: 	You're such a brilliant woman.
                Me: 	Everyone should get to know the real you.
                Violet:	You've helped me come back out of my shell.
                Violet:	Be more open, and spontaneous.
                Violet:	Not many men these days can be so gentle and attentive.
                Me: 	You're very sweet, thank you.
                Me: 	This means we'll have to be secretive a lot of the time.
                Me: 	Sneak around people's back.
                Me: 	Are you okay with this?
                Violet:	I get why this has to remain a secret.
                Violet:	I'm not too entirely comfortable with hiding our affection...
                Violet:	...but this is the only way to go.
                Violet:	I understand that.
                Violet:	Anyway...
                Violet:	The stars are wonderful, aren't they?
                Me: 	Very. I haven't done much stargazing, but seeing this...
                Me: 	It should definitely be on my everyday list.
                Violet:	We could do more than just stargaze.
                Me: 	Oh, what did you have in mind?
                Narr:	You lean onto Violet and kiss her passionately on the lips.
                Narr:	You surrender yourself to her gentleness while starlight reflects on the lake's surface.
                Narr:	You place your tongue on Violet's neck and trace it along her silky skin.
                Violet:	Mmm, keep going, Dennis.
                Violet:	This feels nice.
                Narr:	As your tongue returns to meet hers, your hand involuntarily moves down to Violet's ass.
                Narr:	As you caress her, you feel Violet's lust for you grow stronger.
                Narr:	You gently push her on the floor and take her clothes off...
                Narr:	...as she wordlessly watches you.
                Narr:	As you lie onto her and kiss her, your hand finds her erect nipples.
                Violet:	I'm beyond excited, Dennis.
                Me: 	Mmm, I'm glad.
                Narr:	Your mouth embraces Violet's erect nipple, as your other hand gently squeezes the other one.
                Violet:	Oh, Dennis...
                Me: 	I'll need you to spread your legs for me.
                Narr:	Violet obeys and you position your head in between her legs...
                Narr:	... as you start circling your tongue around her clit.
                Violet:	Gah! *Moans*
                Narr:	After some teasing your tongue finds her sweet spot and continues licking.
                Violet:	*Moans* Ahhh!
                Me: 	*Grunts*
                Narr:	You pick up the pace and start to finger her harder and faster.
                Narr:	Violet's moans disrupt the silence of the night.
                Violet:	Dennis, mmmm. Ahhh! Don't stop.
                Violet:	I'm really close...
                Narr:	You continue fingering her while she moans into the night.
                Violet:	This is--
                Violet:	*Moans* Yesss, mmmm.
                Violet:	I'm--
                Narr:	She twitches in pleasure as she cums onto your mouth.
                Narr:	While her whole body is still shaking, you give her one final lick to which she moans even louder.
                Narr:	You lie next to Violet and marvel at the night sky.
                Me: 	Your taste is addictive.
                Violet:	*Blushes* Thank you.
                Narr:	You stand up to get a better look at Violet.
                Narr:	Violet's hand slides down into your shorts, pulling your cock out.
                Narr:	She starts stroking you as she lays her head onto your chest.
                Me: 	*Mpfh!* *Grunt*
                Narr:	She picks up the pace and soon you're in this sweet oblivion.
                Narr:	Suddenly, your cock is squeezed between her sweet tits.
                Me: 	Oh my god, don't stop...
                Narr:	She continues massaging your dick with her voluptuous breasts as you come closer to finishing.
                Me: 	Violet, I'm gonna--
                Me: 	*Grunts*
                Me: 	Ahhh!
                Me: 	Wow, that was--
                Violet:	Wonderful.
                Me: 	You couldn't have said it better.
                Violet:	I'm glad you came outside.
                Me: 	I'm glad you've got great aim.
                Violet:	*Chuckle* I practice.
                Me: 	Hopefully we can practice again like this, sometime.
                Violet:	You know, I think we just might.
            Me: 	I'm so sorry, Violet. I wish I could.
            Me: 	But I'm really tired.
            Me: 	Besides, it wouldn't look good if I was caught taking late night walks with a patient.
            Violet:	Oh, come on! It's just for a short while.
            Me: 	Some other time...
            Violet:	Whatever. I wanted to do something nice, but...
            Violet:	...never mind.
            Me: 	Violet!
            Me: 	Shit... I hope she understands.
            Me: 	*Sigh* I hope I didn't ruin her night.
    Me: 	(I think I'll play a round... or three.)
    Me: 	(This should be fun.)
    Narr:	You ready yourself as the round begins.
    Narr:	10 minutes pass...
    Narr:	Then another 10.
    Narr:	Then another...
    Narr:	And, another.
    Narr:	Your team won the round, but it's a best-of-three.
    Narr:	You take a quick moment to relax, before the next round begins.
    Narr:	The second round begins, and your focus returns to the screen.
    Narr:	Another half hour goes by and the round is lost, unfortunately.
    Narr:	The third round begins...
    Narr:	Things are getting tense.
    Narr:	All you want is to win this round, and the match.
    Narr:	Your intense focus on the game is visible on your face.
    Narr:	It's coming down to the final moments...
    Narr:	And...
    Narr:	You secure the round, and win the match!
    Me: 	Yes. Yes!
    Me: 	(Oh shit, I should be more quiet.)
    Me: 	(Yes yes yes...)
    Me: 	(That was a great match.)
    Me: 	*Yawn* That match made me even sleepier than I was...
    Me: 	I think it's time for bed.
    Me: 	(I should go brush my teeth, first.)
    Me: 	*Yawn*
            Belle:	(I really thought he'd be too timid for something like that.)
            Belle:	(That threesome was such a wonderful surprise.)
            Belle:	(Maybe he is freaky, like me.)
            Belle:	(He has no idea what's coming for him...)
            Belle:	(That was a nice way to spice things up.)
            Belle:	(Even though the water was a bit cold, he delivered.)
            Belle:	(It was a smooth ride.)
            Belle:	(One I intend to ride again...)
            Belle:	(I love teasing Dennis.)
            Belle:	(He's always so flustered around me.)
            Belle:	(It's cute.)
        Belle:	(I can't get enough of his long, thick, dick.)
        Belle:	(Now I need it to sleep better...)
        Belle:	(Every night.)
        Belle:	(He won't be able to resist me.)
        Belle:	(Just like the others couldn't...)
        Belle:	(What's the easiest way to go about this?)
        Belle:	(Oh, looks like someone left the window open down here...)
        Belle:	(Perfect for little ol' me.)
        Belle:	Hmpft!
        Belle:	*Grunts*
        Belle:	(Gotta keep quiet...)
        Belle:	(Wouldn't want my fun spoiled.)
        Narr:	Belle slowly inches her way upstairs, attempting to be as quiet as possible.
        Belle:	(Why couldn't his room be on the ground floor?)
        Belle:	(I should really consider changing my name to Belle Ninja after this.)
        Belle:	(Now... Where is the guest of honor?)
        Belle:	(Pleasuring someone?)
        Belle:	(Or, jerking off in the shower?)
        Belle:	(I might as well make myself comfortable.)
        Narr:	A couple minutes later...
        Belle:	Finally!
        Narr:	You almost gasp seeing Belle on your bed.
        Me: 	Belle!
        Me: 	What the--
        Belle:	I've been waiting for you.
        Me: 	*Quietly* Are you crazy!?
        Me: 	What were you thinking coming here?
        Belle:	To answer your first question, perhaps.
        Belle:	In a good way, of course. 
        Belle:	As for the second question, I didn't.
        Belle:	I was guided by my yearning for good dick.
        Belle:	Seeing yours is so delicious, here I am.
        Belle:	You couldn't possibly say no to me, could you?
            Belle:	You couldn't possibly say no to me, could you?
                Me: 	How could I possibly turn you down, Belle?
                Me: 	Your body is too tempting for me to say no.
                Me: 	Our fun earlier today has only made me want you more.
                Belle:	I'm glad we're on the same page.
                Belle:	I'd gladly give you a mind-blowing experience.
                Belle:	Shall we?
                Me: 	What exactly do you mean by a mind-blowing experience?
                Belle:	Just kick back...
                Belle:	...and relax.
                Belle:	I'll give you the IRL "e-girl experience."
                Me: 	I feel so blessed...
                Belle:	Oh, you better.
                Belle:	You're getting something not even my biggest fans can have.
                Me: 	You trying to convert me into one of your simps?
                Belle:	*Giggle* Of cooourse not.
                Me: 	It sounds like that sentence has a "but" attached.
                Belle:	But... I wouldn't mind that.
                Me: 	I'm sure you wouldn't.
                Belle:	Dennis... Focus.
                Me: 	Yeah, sorry.
                Belle:	Just let yourself be taken to a place of fantasy.
                Belle:	Now, what kind of experience would you like?
                Me: 	Uhh...
                Me: 	*Chuckle* What's on the menu?
                Belle:	Well... I do have some notable classics.
                Me: 	Care to list them off for me?
                Belle:	Ugh. That kills the surprise...
                Me: 	I mean, how can I know what my choices are if you don't tell me?
                Belle:	Yeah, you're right.
                Belle:	Soooo...
                Belle:	Here's a list of my "greatest hits."
                Belle:	Punished Thief.
                Belle:	You know... A naughty little slut has stolen something from you.
                Belle:	Now, she needs some reprimanding.
                Me: 	Mhm.
                Belle:	Stepmom Catches You.
                Belle:	Your sexy stepmom caught you doing something naughty...
                Belle:	She needs to teach you a lesson.
                Me: 	Okay.
                Belle:	Teacher Needs Something Special.
                Belle:	I'm a bad, bad student who failed her class...
                Belle:	Maybe if I do something for Mr. Professor, he'll let me pass?
                Me: 	Yeah.
                Belle:	Stuck Under the Bed.
                Me: 	I get it...
                Belle:	Oh no, I'm stuck and can't get out!
                Belle:	Please help me, Dennis.
                Me: 	I'm quite familiar with that trick...
                Belle:	And, last but not least...
                Belle:	A classic most of my follower adore.
                Belle:	The "Hentai" Face, aka ahegao.
                Me: 	Hmm, haven't heard of that.
                Belle:	Really, now?
                Me: 	Really.
                Belle:	Well, then...
                Belle:	If you pick that, you're in for a treat.
                Belle:	So, sexy...
                Belle:	What will it be?
                Me: 	Hmm...
                Me: 	What if I want to experience them all?
                Belle:	*Giggle* I think we have enough time for that.
                Narr:	Belle awaits your decision while being as sexy as possible.
                    Me: 	Why don't we try that hentai face.
                    Belle:	Ooooh, kinkyyy.
                    Belle:	Very, very good choice...
                    Belle:	Just you wait...
                    Belle:	Just a liiiitle longer...
                    Narr:	You're shocked and pleased by this choice.
                    Me: 	Damn...
                    Me: 	That's sexy as fuck.
                    Belle:	Your dick gets hard quickly, and you can't help but stroke it.
                    Belle:	Oooh, yeah.
                    Belle:	Stroke your huge cock in front of meeeee.
                Me: 	I wouldn't be able to resist...
                Belle:	Then, don't.
                Belle:	Just look at my lewd face...
                Belle:	Aaaahhh... Ooohhh...
                Me: 	Fuck, if you keep doing that...
                Me: 	I'm gonna...
                Belle:	Go crazy?
                Me: 	Yeah, on you.
                Narr:	Looking at Belle's face makes you lose yourself.
                Narr:	Within seconds, you're on top of Belle.
                    Me: 	You like that?
                    Belle:	Yeeeeeaaah...
                    Belle:	*Moans* Mmmm...
                    Belle:	Hhnngg... Mmm...
                    Me: 	*Moan* Fuu...
                    Me: 	Yeaaah...
                    Belle:	Oooohhhh, Dennis...
                    Belle:	*Gasps* Aaahhh...
                    Me: 	You know...
                    Me: 	You really shouldn't have stolen from someone like me.
                    Belle:	I'm sorry, mister.
                    Belle:	I didn't know I was stealing from someone like you.
                    Me: 	Now, I'm going to have to punish you...
                    Me: 	It's only appropriate for a thief like you.
                    Belle:	Whatever you want, mister.
                    Me: 	*Quietly* Hands behind your back!
                Me: 	Yeah, just like that...
                Belle:	What are you going to do to me?
                Me: 	I think that's a question you should be asking yourself...
                Me: 	How you're going to make it up to me.
                Me: 	So I can look the other way.
                Belle:	Oooohhh... I see...
                Me: 	Glad we're on the same page...
                Me: 	Now, time to repay me for what you've stolen.
                    Belle:	*Moans* Fuuuc--
                    Me: 	You like that?
                    Belle:	Mhm... Do you?
                    Me: 	I do...
                    Me: 	...but, I think I need some more.
                    Belle:	Whatever you want...
                    Me: 	Ooooh, yeah. Say you're sorry.
                    Belle:	Sorry, not sorry.
                    Belle:	Punish me more, mister.
                    Belle:	Mmmm... Fuuuck yeah...
                    Me: 	*Quietly* How about the stepmom thing?
                    Belle:	Good choice.
                    Belle:	Very kinky, Dennis...
                Belle:	*Gasp* What are you doing?
                Me: 	Well, something private.
                Me: 	I thought I could at least have some privacy in my own roon.
                Belle:	Who taught you to do this?
                Me: 	No one...
                Belle:	Have you been watching porn?
                Belle:	Very bad...
                Belle:	Your father will be so angry...
                Belle:	What were you thinking?
                Me: 	What's the problem?
                Me: 	You're the one who barged into my room.
                Belle:	My problem... is that you tried to hide this from me.
                Me: 	Oh?
                Belle:	How dare you not share this with me...
                Belle:	I thought you trusted me.
                Me: 	I do...
                Belle:	Then trust me with your most prized possession...
                Belle:	I'm going to take care of you...
                Belle:	But, you better take care of me, too.
                Belle:	Not like your father does...
                Belle:	He's never here... and I get so lonely.
                Me: 	Do you?
                Belle:	Mhm... But, you're helping me feel better.
                Belle:	So, I'm going to make you feel better.
                Belle:	Show you something I can do better than any of the girls your age.
                    Me: 	Oh my go--
                    Belle:	Mmmwah! Aahh...
                    Belle:	Do you like that?
                    Me: 	Yeah...
                    Belle:	Do you like fucking my throat?
                    Me: 	It's so good...
                    Belle:	So naughty...
                    Me: 	Oh yeah?
                    Belle:	...but so much better than your father.
                    Belle:	I'm not going to let you go so easily...
                    Me: 	Good. Keep... keep going.
                    Belle:	*Slurp* I'm the one who should be telling you what to do.
                    Belle:	*Gasp* Not the other way around.
                    Me: 	Yes, ma'am.
                    Belle:	*Gggkg* You're so goddamn big.
                    Belle:	*Slurp* I can't believe I had such a well endowed stepson.
                    Belle:	*Moan* This can be our little secret.
                    Me: 	Fuck... yeah.
                    Belle:	*Gasp* Naughty, using such foul language like that.
                    Belle:	*Gluug* Naughty, naughty.
                    Me: 	Aaah... fuuu...
                    Me: 	I can't believe you.
                    Belle:	Hmm? What do you mean?
                    Me: 	You come to class, but you don't try.
                    Belle:	Oooh...
                    Me: 	You've barely even given more than 30%% of your all to this class.
                    Belle:	Sorry, professor...
                    Me: 	No, Belle...
                    Me: 	Don't apologize to me.
                    Me: 	Apologize to yourself.
                    Belle:	Aww... shoot.
                    Me: 	You really dropped the ball this semester, didn't you?
                    Belle:	Yeah, I did...
                    Belle:	But, it wasn't on purpose.
                    Me: 	And, what's your excuse this time?
                    Belle:	I... I had some things come up.
                    Belle:	Some obligations I couldn't drop.
                    Me: 	I understand that.
                    Me: 	Those things can happen...
                    Belle:	Maybe...
                Belle:	Maybe I can make it up to you, somehow.
                Me: 	I think...
                Me: 	I think you're already on the right track.
                Belle:	Good...
                    Belle:	*Moans* This is so good...
                    Me: 	*Grunts* This is... indeed... good.
                    Me: 	I think your grade is rising as we speak.
                    Belle:	I can feel something else rising, too...
                    Belle:	*Moans* Fuuu...
                    Belle:	Shove your yard stick in deeper, professor.
                    Me: 	*Grunts* I hope... this lesson...
                    Me: 	Teaches you to pay attention in class.
                    Belle:	Yes, sir.
                    Me: 	You know...
                    Me: 	*Grunt* You're really shaping up... 
                    Me: 	*Grunt* ...to be my favorite student.
                    Belle:	*Moans* And, you're my favorite professor.
                    Me: 	I think I left something under my bed, Belle.
                    Belle:	Oh?
                    Me: 	Would you mind getting it for me?
                    Belle:	Oh, of course not...
                    Belle:	I'm happy to help.
                    Me: 	Great. It shouldn't be too hard...
                    Belle:	Uh, Dennis?
                    Me: 	Yeah?
                    Belle:	I think...
                    Belle:	I think I got stuck.
                    Me: 	Are you serious?
                Belle:	Yeah, I can't wiggle out.
                Me: 	Wiggle a little harder, then.
                Belle:	I'm trying.
                Belle:	I really can't get out.
                Belle:	Would you mind... helping me out?
                Me: 	*Sigh* I can't believe this.
                Me: 	How the hell could you get stuck under a bed with so much space?
                Belle:	I don't know. Maybe your bed won't let me go?
                Belle:	So, are you going to help me out?
                Belle:	Or, are you going to keep drooling over my ass?
                Me: 	Don't worry, little lady.
                Me: 	I've got you.
                Belle:	Aaaaand?
                Me: 	Hmm...
                Me: 	You're really stuck under there.
                Belle:	Maybe if I do this...
                Me: 	That might... help.
                Belle:	If it'll help...
                Belle:	Then I'll do this even more.
                Me: 	I won't be able to resist...
                Belle:	Then don't.
                Me: 	Okay.
                    Belle:	MMMMmmmmmmfff...
                    Me: 	It's so tight...
                    Belle:	And you're so big...
                    Belle:	*Moan* I'm still... so stuck.
                    Me: 	*Groan* I'll get you out...
                    Belle:	Hnng... Shake me around some more...
                    Me: 	Oh... I will.
                    Narr:	The lewdness of Belle's behavior excites you more than you could have imagined.
                    Narr:	You add that excitement to your thrusting...
                    Narr:	Bringing you both close to the edge...
                    Me: 	I can't take it...
                    Me: 	Your damn face... it's so...
                    Belle:	Yeeees... yeeeeees...
                    Narr:	Soon, you can't hold back any longer...
                    Me: 	Oh fuck... I'm gonna...
                    Belle:	*Quietly* Give it to meeee!
                    Me: 	That was...
                    Belle:	So kinky...
                    Me: 	Yeah...
                    Narr:	The lewdness of the role playing excites you more than you could have imagined.
                    Narr:	The excitement transforms into raw passion...
                    Narr:	Bringing you both close to climax...
                    Me: 	I can't... take it...
                    Me: 	This fantasy...
                    Belle:	I swear, this is the last time...
                    Belle:	*Moans* I'll never steal from you again.
                    Narr:	Soon, you can't hold back any longer...
                    Me: 	I'm gonna...
                    Belle:	*Quietly* I want it all!
                    Me: 	That was...
                    Belle:	So hot...
                    Me: 	Yeah...
                    Me: 	That was pretty hot...
                    Me: 	*Chuckles* For a thief.
                    Belle:	Sexiest thief around.
                    Narr:	The lewdness of the role playing excites you more than you could have imagined.
                    Narr:	Especially given this particular taboo.
                    Narr:	The excitement transforms into raw passion...
                    Narr:	Bringing you both close to climax...
                    Me: 	I can't... take it...
                    Me: 	This fantasy...
                    Belle:	I think I taught you a lesson...
                    Me: 	*Moans* I'll remember to share myself with you, stepmom.
                    Narr:	Soon, you can't hold back any longer...
                    Me: 	I'm gonna...
                    Belle:	*Quietly* Give it to your new mommy.
                    Me: 	That was...
                    Belle:	*Gasp* Aah!
                    Belle:	So hot...
                    Me: 	Yeah...
                    Me: 	That was pretty hot...
                    Me: 	*Chuckles* Also kinda weird.
                    Belle:	Don't kink shame.
                    Belle:	Especially because you enjoyed it...
                    Narr:	The lewdness of the role playing excites you more than you could have imagined.
                    Narr:	The excitement transforms into raw passion...

                    Me: 	I can't... take it...
                    Me: 	This fantasy...
                    Belle:	I promise I'll show up to class every day...
                    Belle:	*Moans* Especially now that I know how to have fun learning.
                    Narr:	Soon, you can't hold back any longer...
                    Me: 	I'm gonna...
                    Belle:	*Quietly* Give me an A!
                    Me: 	That was...
                    Belle:	So hot...
                    Me: 	Yeah...
                    Me: 	That was pretty hot...
                    Me: 	*Chuckles* You know, I think you managed to pass the class.
                    Belle:	You really are a hunk, professor.
                    Narr:	The lewdness of the role playing excites you more than you could have imagined.
                    Narr:	The excitement transforms into raw passion...
                    Narr:	Bringing you both close to climax...
                    Me: 	I think...
                    Me: 	*Groan* I think I've got... you...
                    Belle:	I feel it...
                    Belle:	I'm nearly... free!
                    Narr:	Soon, you can't hold back any longer...
                    Me: 	I'm gonna...
                    Belle:	*Quietly* Free me!
                    Me: 	That was...
                    Belle:	So hot...
                    Me: 	Yeah...
                    Me: 	That was pretty hot...
                    Me: 	*Chuckles* Despite how stupid that was.
                    Belle:	Hey, now...
                    Belle:	Silly can be kinda sexy.
                Me: 	I could do that again.
                Belle:	I could too.
                Belle:	Depends how good you are to me, though.
                Me: 	And how much privacy, and time, we have...
                Me: 	Which, I'm afraid we're currently out of.
                Belle:	Aww... Well, it's okay.
                Me: 	I'm glad you understand...
                Me: 	It's not really in my control.
                Belle:	Don't worry about it, Dennis.
                Narr:	You both get dressed quickly.
                Belle:	So, handsome...
                Belle:	Thanks again for this.
                Me: 	I should be thanking you, honestly.
                Belle:	Let's call it mutually beneficial that we're friendly like this.
                Me: 	Sounds good to me.
                Me: 	Uh... Sorry...
                Belle:	Wait... Are you serious?
                Me: 	Yeeeeah.
                Belle:	You want me to climb out the window?
                Me: 	I don't, but that's the only way you won't get caught.
                Belle:	Oh, fuck off...
                Belle:	I could slip!
                Me: 	I can lower you down with my sheets?
                Belle:	You have to be joking.
                Me: 	Uhm...
                Belle:	Okay, hell no.
                Belle:	I'm leaving.
                Me: 	Fine, fine. I get it... We wouldn't want you to get hurt.
                Belle:	Thank you.
                Me: 	Just... be extra quiet.
                Me: 	If someone caught you, that would be it for our midnight rendezvous.
                Belle:	We wouldn't want that, now.
                Belle:	I'll be quiet as a mouse.
                Me: 	Sounds good, Belle.
                Belle:	Promise me...
                Me: 	Hmm?
                Belle:	Promise me next time we can do this somewhere else.
                Me: 	I didn't know you were going to just appear in my room.
                Belle:	That is true...
                Belle:	Anyway, I better get going.
                Belle:	Night, handsome.
                Me: 	Night, sexy.
                Me: 	*Yawn* What a wild night.
                Me: 	I'm pretty exhausted from all that exercise.
                Me: 	I can and I will.
                Me: 	You can't be in here, and you know that.
                Belle:	Says who?
                Me: 	Don't play dumb.
                Belle:	Why do you always have to be such a bore?
                Belle:	I know you enjoy fucking me.
                Belle:	So why do you want to deny us this pleasure?
                Belle:	I'm presenting you with a wonderful opportunity.
                Belle:	It would be a shame to pass it up.
                Me: 	Belle, Eve is sleeping next door.
                Me: 	As is everyone else.
                Me: 	I'd like to keep my job, thank you very much.
                Me: 	(Not to mention the opportunity to enjoy the company of multiple hot women.)
                Belle:	I can be very quiet.
                Belle:	While you stick it in me.
                Me: 	(She's relentless.)
                Me: 	The answer is still no, I'm afraid.
                Belle:	We can just sleep here, together.
                Belle:	Share our warmth.
                Me: 	Belle.
                Me: 	No means no.
                Belle:	Fine.
                Belle:	I hope you sleep horribly.
                Me: 	Where do you think you're going?
                Belle:	Out. Like you told me to.
                Me: 	Not through the house.
                Belle:	What?!
                Belle:	How the hell am I supposed to leave, then?
                Me: 	I don't know...
                Me: 	How did you even get in here in the first place?
                Belle:	Wouldn't you like to know?
                Me: 	You know what? I would, but I don't have the time for this.
                Me: 	Just be quiet when you leave...
                Belle:	Fine.
                Belle:	Asshole.
                Narr:	Belle sneaks out of your room silently, like before.
                Narr:	You look at Belle's exquisite ass one last time as she goes.
                Me: 	(What a woman...)
                Me: 	*Yawn* And, what a day.
        Me: 	(It's too early for bed.)
        Me: 	Hmm...
            Me: 	(OH!)
            Me: 	(I wonder what's Naomi up to...)
            Me: 	(Guess I could go see her.)
            Me: 	(She'd appreciate it.)
            Me: 	(And, I'm not too tired...)
            Me: 	(But, am I taking this too far with the patients?)
            Me: 	(Pretty soon they might...)
            Me: 	(...call me their boyfriend.)
            Me: 	(And, if Eve found that out...)
            Narr:	Your body autonomously shudders at the thought.
            Me: 	(Eh, who knows.)
            Me: 	(Maybe I'm making it into a bigger deal than it really is.)
            Me: 	(Come on, Dennis. Just choose something.)
                Me: 	(Come on, Dennis. Just choose something.)
                    Me: 	(I think I'd rather just stay in, tonight.)
                    Me: 	(Hell, if she asks why I didn't come...)
                    Me: 	(I'll tell her I accidentally fell asleep.)
                    Me: 	(That's completely believable.)
                    Me: 	*Yawn* (It has been a pretty long day.)
            Narr:	Your cell phone vibrates, and the screen lights up.
            Me: 	Oh? Someone messaged me?
            Me: 	(Aha, of course! Naomi.)
            Me: 	Oh.
                Me: 	How sweet.
                Me: 	(It is a great picture of us.)
                Me: 	(I'm glad this was her way of reminding me.)
                Me: 	(I did promise Naomi I would come by later.)
                Me: 	(I'd say it's late enough...)
                Me: 	(Guess I could go see her.)
            Me: 	(She would appreciate it.)
            Me: 	(And, I'm not too tired...)
            Me: 	(But, is this taking it too far?)
            Me: 	(Pretty soon she might...)
            Me: 	(...get attached, or something.)
            Me: 	(And, if Eve found that out...)
            Narr:	Your body autonomously shudders at the thought.
            Me: 	(Eh, who knows.)
            Me: 	(Maybe I'm making this into a bigger deal than it really is.)
            Me: 	(I should decide something before it gets too late.)
                Me: 	(Come on, Dennis. Just choose something.)
                    Me: 	(Why not?)
                    Me: 	(I'm sure it'll be a nice time.)
                    Me: 	(And, Naomi wouldn't appreciate being ghosted.)
                    Me: 	(Might as well take this with me.)
                    Me: 	(Could come in handy.)
                    Me: 	(Quietly, now.)
                    Me: 	(Don't want Emily or Kiara snooping around.)
                    Narr:	While walking down the path, the cool air refreshes you.
                    Narr:	Shaking any lingering sleepiness from you.
                    Narr:	Above you, in the cosmos, the stars twinkle and shine.
                    Me: 	(Everybody needs to experience the great outdoors sometimes.)
                    Me: 	(There's nothing quite as breathtaking...)
                    Narr:	Sitting on the steps of her cabin,
                    Narr:	you see another breathtaking sight.
                    Naomi:	*Quietly* Hey, handsome.
                    Me: 	*Quietly* Evening, Naomi.
                    Naomi:	So, you took me up on that offer?
                    Me: 	Why wouldn't I?
                    Naomi:	Oh, I don't know.
                    Naomi:	Maybe you thought it's too good to be true?
                    Me: 	And, if it were true and I didn't show up...
                    Me: 	I'd feel like an idiot.
                    Naomi:	Touche.
                    Naomi:	So, Prince Charming...
                    Naomi:	Where ever will you take me?
                    Me: 	I've got an idea...
                    Me: 	Close your eyes.
                    Naomi:	Oooohhh... Nice touch.
                    Naomi:	Lead the way.
                        Naomi:	Lead the way.
                            Me: 	You can open your eyes, now.
                            Naomi:	Oh my...
                            Naomi:	Dennis, you shouldn't have.
                            Me: 	What, is something wrong?
                            Naomi:	No, no...
                            Naomi:	You really know how to treat a woman right.
                            Me: 	Good, I was hoping you'd appreciate the gesture.
                            Naomi:	It's literally the best option available at this camp.
                            Naomi:	Everywhere else is either dirty or wet.
                            Me: 	Gotta love the great outdoors, huh?
                            Naomi:	I definitely do...
                            Naomi:	But, I also like my creature comforts.
                            Me: 	As we all do.
                            Me: 	Anyway, after you.
                            Naomi:	Thank you.
                            Naomi:	Not too shabby...
                            Me: 	Thank you.
                            Naomi:	...for an unused cabin.
                            Me: 	I guess Eve just likes to keep this place ready.
                            Me: 	Just in case.
                            Naomi:	Seems like it.
                            Naomi:	But, it looks like someone has been here recently.
                            Me: 	What makes you say that?
                            Naomi:	Well, the bed is just slightly disheveled.
                            Naomi:	Like someone sat on it recently.
                            Me: 	Maybe Emily or Kiara made the bed quickly.
                            Me: 	They're known to cut corners.
                            Naomi:	*Chuckle* I thought you were Mr. Corner-Cutter?
                            Me: 	Hey, now...
                            Me: 	You wouldn't want me to toss you on that bed for saying something like that...
                            Naomi:	Maybe I do.
                            Me: 	Maybe you won't even need to tease me to get thrown on the bed.
                            Naomi:	Come get me.
                            Me: 	There's no stopping me now.
                            Naomi:	*Giggle* Aaah!
                            Me: 	Got ya!
                            Naomi:	*Giggle* Nooo, please don't trim my corners off.
                            Me: 	*Chuckle* You're still on that joke?
                            Naomi:	*Chuckle* I'll drop it, I'll drop it...
                            Me: 	Good.
                            Naomi:	Come over here...
                            Me: 	My pleasure...
                            Naomi:	Take a load off... relax.
                            Me: 	Aahh... That feels great, Naomi.
                            Me: 	Especially after all the work I've been doing.
                            Naomi:	You are quite the hard worker.
                            Naomi:	Especially with your role as Red Falls' resident people pleaser...
                            Me: 	I'm jus--
                            Naomi:	Ssshhh...
                            Naomi:	I was trying to say that you've pleased me quite well.
                            Me: 	I'm happy to hear that...
                            Me: 	I wonder if this will also please you...
                            Naomi:	That definitely pleased me.
                            Naomi:	But, I'd like more pleasure.
                            Naomi:	If you'd be happy to obli--
                            Naomi:	Mmmm...
                            Naomi:	Ah!
                            Naomi:	So smooth.
                            Me: 	You think so?
                            Me: 	I'm definitely a rebel without a cause.
                            Naomi:	Show me more of that rebellious spirit...
                            Me: 	Say no more.
                            Naomi:	Ooooh... Wonderful...
                            Narr:	Within seconds, both of you are undressed.
                            Me: 	God, you're beautiful.
                            Naomi:	So are you.
                            Me: 	*Chuckle* I'm beautiful?
                            Naomi:	Ugh, handsome. Is that good for you?
                            Me: 	That's better.
                            Naomi:	I just don't get why wording matters if intent is the same.
                            Me: 	Well, I just...
                            Me: 	I guess you're right. Who cares?
                            Narr:	Naomi, eager to regain your focus, kisses you again.
                            Naomi:	Ssshhh...
                            Naomi:	Let's let passion lead us.
                            Naomi:	Wonderful...
                            Naomi:	*Moan* Somehow...
                            Naomi:	You know all my favorite spots...
                            Me: 	Call it intuition?
                            Naomi:	Call it whatever you want...
                            Naomi:	*Moans* Just keep doing it.
                            Me: 	Shiiit, that feels good, Naomi.
                            Naomi:	You know what would feel better?
                            Naomi:	Giving it to me. Hard.
                            Me: 	How would you like it?
                            Naomi:	You'd probably do it better if you're standing.
                            Naomi:	Just my two cents.
                            Me: 	(I could stand while she's on the edge of the bed...)
                            Naomi:	Just surprise me.
                            Me: 	(Oh, I think I can think of something surprising...)
                                Naomi:	Oh...
                                Me: 	What, bad choice?
                                Naomi:	No, no... It's just a little bit vanilla.
                                Me: 	And, vanilla isn't good enough?
                                Naomi:	No, no...
                                Naomi:	I'm sure this will be fun.
                            Naomi:	Mmmmfff...
                            Naomi:	Guess this will be better than vanilla...
                            Me: 	You'll see...
                            Naomi:	Come on, already.
                            Naomi:	Fuck me, hard.
                            Narr:	Naomi dropping her usual lady-like demeanor surprises you.
                            Me: 	That's what I like to hear.
                            Naomi:	Oooohhh...
                            Naomi:	*Moans* Mmm...
                            Naomi:	So fuuuucking deep...
                            Me: 	See?
                            Me: 	Vanilla still feels amazing.
                            Naomi:	*Moans* Mmhhhm...
                            Naomi:	Iiiit dooooes...
                                Naomi:	Ah! Dennis!
                                Me: 	I thought you said I should surprise you.
                                Me: 	I think I picked the most surprising option.
                                Naomi:	No, no... I like it.
                                Naomi:	You genuinely surprised me.
                                Me: 	Glad to be of service.
                                Naomi:	Serve my pussy...
                                Me: 	Oh, I will...
                            Naomi:	*Moans* Ooooohhh... Fuuuu...
                            Me: 	*Grunts* Yeah...
                            Me: 	Take it...
                            Naomi:	Mmmmggghhh...
                            Naomi:	Yes, yes...
                            Naomi:	*Moans* Fuuuuck meeee...
                            Me: 	*Grunts* Ooohhh, yeeeahhh...
                                Naomi:	Oooohh... Dennis...
                                Me: 	What, bad choice?
                                Naomi:	No, no... I like it.
                                Naomi:	I see how you like it now, too.
                                Me: 	Glad we both have more... primal desires.
                                Naomi:	Fuck me like an animal...
                                Me: 	Oh, I will...
                            Naomi:	Mmmmfff... You really want to break me...
                            Me: 	Well...
                            Naomi:	Go ahead.
                            Naomi:	Fuck me in the ass.
                            Narr:	Naomi dropping her usual lady-like demeanor surprises you.
                            Naomi:	Are you going to tease me forever?
                            Me: 	You surprised me this time.
                            Naomi:	Excellent...
                            Naomi:	Now, stick it in already.
                            Naomi:	Oooohhh, shiii...
                            Naomi:	So deep...
                            Me: 	So good.
                            Naomi:	*Moans* Mmhhhm...
                            Naomi:	Ooooohhhh... Yeeessss...
                                Narr:	You both managed to last a decent amount of time.
                                Narr:	Especially given how passionately you're going at each other.
                                Me: 	I can't... I can't...
                                Naomi:	Don't...
                                Naomi:	Just let it happen...
                                Me: 	*Moans* Fuuu...
                                Naomi:	Fill me up...
                                Naomi:	...you animal.
                                Me: 	Aaahhh!
                                Naomi:	*Gasp* Ooooohhhh fuuuuuuck.
                                Me: 	*Pant* Yeeahh...
                                Naomi:	*Pant* Mmmmm...
                                Me: 	That was...
                                Naomi:	Amazing.
                                Me: 	Yeah.
                                Naomi:	I agree.
                                Narr:	You both reach climax quickly.
                                Narr:	Despite the remarks of this being "vanilla"...
                                Narr:	Naomi also reaches climax quickly.
                                Me: 	I'm gonna...
                                Naomi:	Good...
                                Naomi:	I am too...
                                Naomi:	Just... pull out.
                                Me: 	*Moans* Fuuu...
                                Me: 	Hmmmff...
                                Naomi:	*Gasp* Oooohhh, so hot...
                                Me: 	*Pant* Yeah...
                                Me: 	...you are.
                                Me: 	That was...
                                Naomi:	Surprisingly good.
                                Me: 	Oh, was it? Even thought it was vanilla?
                                Naomi:	You gave vanilla a deeper... flavor.
                                Naomi:	I'll give that to you.
                                Narr:	You both reach a state of bliss...
                                Narr:	Especially given the kinkiness of the current position.
                                Narr:	And, how hard you're going at each other.
                                Me: 	Fuck... I think...
                                Me: 	I'm gonna...
                                Naomi:	Me too...
                                Naomi:	Just let it happen...
                                Me: 	*Moans* Fuuu...
                                Naomi:	*Gasps* Just... Make sure not to drop me.
                                Me: 	I would... never...
                                Me: 	Aaahhh!
                                Naomi:	*Gasp* Ooooohhhh fuuuuuuck!
                                Me: 	*Pant* Yeeahh...
                                Naomi:	*Pant* What the fuck?!
                                Me: 	It was an accident...
                                Me: 	You slipped.
                                Me: 	That was...
                                Naomi:	Amazing...
                                Naomi:	...despite that final surprise.
                                Me: 	Even that was pretty fucking good.
                                Naomi:	You know... it was.
                                Naomi:	You really are full of surprises.
                            Narr:	You both lie there in the bed of Cabin 3.
                            Narr:	Trying your best to regain your composure.
                            Narr:	Savoring the moment fully.
                            Naomi:	Let's do something like this again sometime...
                            Me: 	You'd like that?
                            Naomi:	I always love it when you serve me.
                            Me: 	What... Is that what--
                            Naomi:	*Chuckle* I was joking, silly...
                            Naomi:	No need to get defensive.
                            Naomi:	I love that we shared a moment like this.
                            Naomi:	And that it didn't kill you.
                            Me: 	*Chuckle* Your succubus allure didn't manage to kill me yet.
                            Naomi:	Then, I'll just have to try again.
                            Me: 	For now, unfortunately...
                            Naomi:	Yeah, I get it...
                            Naomi:	You have to clean this cabin?
                            Naomi:	Cover our tracks?
                            Me: 	Exactly.
                            Me: 	You're shaping up to be quite the a prolific writer.
                            Naomi:	Why, thank you.
                            Naomi:	Good night, Dennis.
                            Naomi:	I'm really happy we did this.
                            Me: 	Me too, Naomi.
                            Me: 	Good night.
                            Me: 	You can open your eyes, now.
                            Naomi:	Oh...
                            Me: 	You don't seem so happy about my choice?
                            Naomi:	How could I be?
                            Naomi:	Whenever I come out here I leave with sand in all my nooks and crannies...
                            Me: 	Ah, yeah...
                            Naomi:	And, I'm assuming you don't have a towel stashed in your pants?
                            Me: 	Unfortunately not.
                            Naomi:	Yeah, that is unfortunate...
                            Me: 	If you really want...
                            Me: 	I can be your towel.
                            Naomi:	What?
                            Me: 	Come over here...
                            Me: 	Let me show you what I mean.
                            Me: 	Take a seat.
                            Naomi:	If you insist...
                            Naomi:	Like this?
                            Me: 	Exactly like that.
                            Me: 	So, is this a good compromise?
                            Naomi:	I think it's quite alright.
                            Naomi:	As long as my towel makes sure I don't get sandy.
                            Me: 	I'd never allow that.
                            Naomi:	Wait a second...
                            Naomi:	I don't think we need these...
                            Me: 	So, you want me to get sandy, huh?
                            Me: 	What is this, revenge?
                            Naomi:	*Quietly* Of course not!
                            Naomi:	It's a surprise.
                            Naomi:	Just a second...
                            Naomi:	Get ready...
                            Naomi:	...for pleasure unbridled.
                            Me: 	Oh shit...
                            Naomi:	Happy?
                            Me: 	Happy is too weak of a word for what I feel right now.
                            Naomi:	Oh...
                            Naomi:	No need for words, then...
                            Me: 	Mmm.
                            Me: 	(Her lips are so soft...)
                            Naomi:	You're a great kisser, Dennis...
                            Me: 	Thanks.
                            Naomi:	I hope you bring that same passion to everything you do.
                            Me: 	When it involves you, I think I do.
                            Naomi:	Someone's finally awake...
                            Me: 	Well, he was just waiting for a moment like this.
                            Naomi:	As was I.
                            Me: 	Fuuu--
                            Naomi:	Feels good?
                            Me: 	Yeah.
                            Me: 	Is this a good compromise?
                            Naomi:	Don't worry about the sand...
                            Naomi:	You took care of that.
                            Naomi:	Now, I'm going to take care of you.
                            Me: 	Oh, are y--
                            Naomi:	I want you...
                            Naomi:	*Quietly* I want you to fuck me, hard.
                            Narr:	You oblige Naomi's request immediately.
                            Naomi:	*Gasp* Aahh! Dennis!
                            Me: 	Ssshh...
                            Naomi:	*Muffled* Mmmfffm...
                            Naomi:	*Gasp* Yes... Oooohhh...
                            Naomi:	*Moan* But, you don't need to do that...
                            Naomi:	I promise to be quieter.
                            Me: 	You better.
                            Me: 	Or, I'll have to punish you...
                            Naomi:	Oooohhh... You're really winding me up...
                            Naomi:	But, we should save that kind of play for somewhere else.
                            Naomi:	Somewhere cleaner.
                            Me: 	Oh, I get it...
                            Me: 	You like making things dirty?
                            Naomi:	*Moan* You're so naughty... Dennis.
                            Me: 	Sssshhh...
                            Naomi:	Oh... Oooohhh...
                            Me: 	Oh... yeah...
                            Naomi:	I love feeling your hard dick ramming deep inside me...
                            Me: 	And... I love how good your pussy makes me feel.
                            Narr:	You both enter a state of pure ecstasy.
                            Narr:	Becoming primal in your desires...
                            Narr:	You both keep fucking each other while trying your best to keep quiet.
                            Narr:	Until...
                            Naomi:	*Moan* Dennis... [m!ct]...
                            Naomi:	I'm...
                            Narr:	As Naomi attempts to speak, but the waves of pleasure make it difficult...
                            Narr:	You know what she wanted to say, as you feel the same feeling welling up within you.
                            Me: 	Me too... I'm gonna...
                            Narr:	You quickly pull out,
                            Narr:	And the two of you orgasm simultaneously.
                            Naomi:	*Muffled* aaaaahhh!
                            Narr:	Naomi's belly is covered in your thick, hot, seed.
                            Naomi:	*Gasp* Aahhh... yeah...
                            Me: 	Fuuuuck... That was so...
                            Naomi:	So...
                            Naomi:	Good.
                            Me: 	Having a hard time breathing?
                            Naomi:	Yeah, because of how hard you fucked me...
                            Me: 	Was I a little too rough?
                            Naomi:	No, I feel amazing... I can barely...
                            Naomi:	...think.
                            Narr:	You and Naomi fall to the sand.
                            Narr:	She doesn't seem to care, in her post-orgasm bliss.
                            Narr:	The sand is still warm beneath your tired bodies.
                            Narr:	As you lie there, the stars twinkle and shine above.
                            Me: 	*Pant*
                            Naomi:	*Pant*
                            Me: 	This was really nice...
                            Naomi:	I wish we could stay like this forever.
                            Me: 	Sadly, I doubt we can stay here for more than a few more moments.
                            Naomi:	That's okay...
                            Naomi:	As long as we share more moments like this.
                            Me: 	I'm certain we will.
                            Naomi:	Good.
                            Me: 	Sorry, though.
                            Naomi:	For what?
                            Me: 	All the sand you'll find in your "nooks and crannies" later.
                            Naomi:	*Chuckle* I'm more worried about all the sand in my hair.
                            Me: 	Come on.
                            Me: 	I'll walk you back to your cabin.
                            Naomi:	Always a gentleman.
                            Me: 	You can open your eyes, now.
                            Naomi:	Oh...
                            Me: 	What, you don't like the choice?
                            Naomi:	No, no... It's very sentimental, Dennis.
                            Me: 	I'm glad you think so.
                            Naomi:	However...
                            Naomi:	I'm not really sure what we can do out here?
                            Me: 	Reminisce on our good work.
                            Naomi:	*Chuckle* You sure you're not just trying to pawn more of your work off on me?
                            Me: 	Of course not.
                            Me: 	I would never do something like that to such a fair lady.
                            Naomi:	Well, I'm not pleased with this choice...
                            Naomi:	But, I can get over it.
                            Naomi:	Especially if yo--
                            Naomi:	*Gasp* You really know how to sweep a lady off her feet.
                            Me: 	And you know how to charm a man...
                            Me: 	This man.
                            Naomi:	Dennis... You've...
                            Naomi:	Changed.
                            Me: 	I finally got comfortable.
                            Naomi:	Good. I like this side of you.
                            Me: 	If you keep doing that...
                            Naomi:	What? You won't be able to resist me any longer?
                            Me: 	Well, yeah.
                            Naomi:	Good.
                            Naomi:	That's exactly what I want.
                            Naomi:	You liiike that?
                            Me: 	Yeah, I really do...
                            Naomi:	*Gasp* Dennis!
                            Me: 	Too rough for such a fine lady?
                            Naomi:	No, no... I kind of like it.
                            Naomi:	You should have warned me, though.
                            Me: 	Oops.
                            Me: 	I'll try to remember that next time.
                            Naomi:	Oooh... Next time?
                            Naomi:	Why don't you just focus on this time?
                            Me: 	Oh, I will.
                            Naomi:	Mmmmm...
                            Naomi:	I'm so sensitive there...
                            Me: 	Oh, really?
                            Naomi:	Oooooohhhhh...
                            Naomi:	*Quietly* Yeah... Mmm...
                            Me: 	You like that?
                            Naomi:	Kiss me, again... Harder.
                            Naomi:	Aaahh! Give it to me...
                            Me: 	Say no more.
                            Naomi:	Yes, please...
                            Me: 	Did Belle's nymphomania rub off on you?
                            Naomi:	*Chuckle* No, no.
                            Naomi:	I've just... become fond of you.
                            Me: 	I have too...
                            Me: 	As has my friend.
                            Naomi:	Is your friend going to keep me waiting?
                            Me: 	Of course not.
                            Me: 	My friend is quite the gentleman.
                            Naomi:	Mfff. Oooh, yeah.
                            Me: 	*Grunt* Yeah?
                            Naomi:	*Moan* You're... both... quite the gentlemen.
                            Me: 	Well...
                            Me: 	We're happy to hear it.
                            Me: 	Turn around.
                            Naomi:	Ah! You should have warned me.
                            Me: 	Oops, my bad.
                            Naomi:	*Gasp* Naughty....
                            Me: 	You don't like this?
                            Naomi:	Oh, no. I love this...
                            Naomi:	Keep... it up...
                            Me: 	My pleasure.
                            Me: 	*Groan* You sure I'm not in danger?
                            Naomi:	Hnng... What?
                            Naomi:	What are you talking about?
                            Me: 	Your amazing pussy might kill me, and send me straight to heaven.
                            Naomi:	*Giggle* I'd be right behind you, given what your friend is doing to me.
                            Me: 	Too rough?
                            Naomi:	Oh, no. It's heavenly.
                            Me: 	*Chuckle* (Now she's starting to sound like Stacy).
                            Me: 	I love your sense of humor, Naomi.
                            Naomi:	Good. But, please focus.
                            Me: 	Say no more.
                            Naomi:	*Moan* Fuuuu...
                            Me: 	Mmmgghh...
                            Naomi:	Oh my god...
                            Me: 	Fuck yeah.
                            Naomi:	Aaah!!
                            Narr:	You both fall into the throes of passion.
                            Narr:	Becoming primal in your desires...
                            Narr:	Fucking each other senselessly.
                            Narr:	Until...
                            Naomi:	*Moan* Dennis... I'm...
                            Narr:	As Naomi begins speaking, you feel a feeling welling up deep inside you.
                            Narr:	You're sure this is how Naomi feels, right now.
                            Me: 	Me too... I'm gonna...
                            Narr:	You quickly pull out, and the two of you orgasm simultaneously.
                            Naomi:	AAAAAHhhhh!
                            Narr:	Naomi's ass is covered in your thick, hot, seed.
                            Naomi:	Oooohhh... yeah...
                            Me: 	Fuuuuck... That was so...
                            Me: 	So...
                            Me: 	Good.
                            Naomi:	Took your breath away?
                            Me: 	That you did.
                            Me: 	How do you feel?
                            Naomi:	I feel amazing... I can barely...
                            Naomi:	...think.
                            Narr:	You hold Naomi in the grass beneath the tree.
                            Narr:	The grass still retains its warmth from the hot summer's day...
                            Narr:	The stars above you twinkle and shine.
                            Narr:	You both sink into the bliss of the moment.
                            Naomi:	This is so nice...
                            Me: 	Yeah, it is.
                            Naomi:	I could stay like this forever.
                            Narr:	You both close your eyes to capture the moment in your minds.
                            Me: 	I feel like I'll remember this moment for a long time...
                            Naomi:	You better.
                            Narr:	Sitting there beneath the tree, holding each other warmly...
                            Narr:	You begin to drift to sleep.
                            Narr:	Luckily, you body jolts as if its falling, startling you out of sleep's grasp.
                            Me: 	Ah!
                            Naomi:	What is it, Dennis?
                            Me: 	I was so comfortable I nearly fell asleep.
                            Me: 	We should head back before we fall asleep out here.
                            Naomi:	Yeah, we should.
                            Naomi:	I was also getting a bit too comfortable.
                            Me: 	Come on.
                            Me: 	Let's get you back to bed.
                            Naomi:	Thank you, again, Prince Charming.
    Me: 	Wow.
    Me: 	(I never would have imagined something like that happening...)
    Me: 	(Especially not with Violet.)
    Me: 	(She actually has come out of her shell.)
    Me: 	(I guess Eve really is working some magic here.)
Narr:	As you walk away from the girls' campground, you have a strange feeling...
Narr:	Like you're not alone out there.
Me: 	(Is someone else out here?)
Narr:	You look around at your surroundings.
Narr:	Off in the distance, you notice some movement.
Narr:	Focusing your eyes in the darkness, you see it's a person.
Me: 	Could it be... Stacy?
Narr:	Focusing your eyes more intently on the person,
Narr:	you come to realize it is indeed her.
Me: 	(Stacy.)
Me: 	(I should follow her...)
Me: 	(Just to make sure she's okay.)
Me: 	(Damn, she's fast.)
Me: 	(But, where is she going?)
Me: 	(Should I follow her to see where she goes?)
Me: 	(She has been acting off...)
Me: 	(Maybe I should ask her if she's okay?)
    Me: 	(Maybe I should ask her if she's okay?)
Me: 	(I really hope I sleep soundly tonight...)
Me: 	*Yawn* (No sulfurous skies, or shadow Stacies.)
Narr:	You feel a strange urge to look out the window.
Narr:	Maybe some lingering feeling brought up by remembering your dream.
Me: 	(Might as well follow my gut...)
Me: 	(I don't really...)
Me: 	(...see anyth--)
Narr:	With your hawk-like eyes, you notice someone wandering outside.
Me: 	Could it be... her?
Narr:	Focusing your eyes more intently on the person,
Narr:	you come to realize it is indeed her.
Me: 	(Stacy.)
Me: 	(I need to get out there quickly, before I lose her!)
Me: 	(Quietly, but quickly...)
Me: 	(Don't wanna wake anyone up...)
Me: 	(This is a sensitive situation...)
Me: 	(Close it quietly, and then I'm in the clear.)
Me: 	(Now, where is she?)
Me: 	(Damn, she's fast.)
Me: 	(There she is!)
Me: 	(But, where is she going?)
Me: 	(Should I follow her to see where she goes?)
Me: 	(She has been acting off...)
Me: 	(Maybe I should ask her if she's okay?)
    Me: 	(Maybe I should ask her if she's okay?)
Narr:	You decide to stop Stacy.
Me: 	(She really shouldn't be walking this way so late at night.)
Me: 	Hey, Stacy?
Me: 	Stacy?
Stacy:	Ah!
Stacy:	H-hello, ashen prince.
Stacy:	W-what's wrong?
Me: 	Stacy, why are you out here?
Stacy:	I...
Stacy:	I don't...
Me: 	It's okay, it's okay...
Me: 	Come on. I'll take you back to your cabin.
Stacy:	T-thank you...
Stacy:	I...
Me: 	Ssshh... Everything is okay.
Narr:	You decide to follow Stacy a bit longer...
Narr:	Just to see what she's been up to during the night.
Me: 	(She's just kinda... trudging along.)
Me: 	(Why is she walking so lazily?)
Me: 	(It's like she's in a trance...)
Me: 	(And, where the hell is she going?)
Narr:	However, your curiosity doesn't get the better of your judgement.
Me: 	(I should go talk to her.)
Me: 	(She really shouldn't be all the way out here so late at night.)
Me: 	Hey, Stacy?
Me: 	Stacy?
Me: 	Stacy!
Stacy:	Ah!
Stacy:	H-hello, ashen prince.
Stacy:	W-what's wrong?
Me: 	Stacy, why are you out here?
Stacy:	I...
Stacy:	I don't...
Me: 	It's okay, it's okay...
Me: 	Come on. I'll take you back to your cabin.
Stacy:	T-thank you...
Stacy:	I...
Me: 	Ssshh... Everything is okay.
Me: 	Come on, we're almost there.
Stacy:	Thank you, again...
Stacy:	I don't know what came over me.
Me: 	You've probably just been stressed.
Me: 	I know the sudden change in environment can be a shock.
Me: 	Hell, I was also shocked when I got here...
Me: 	Given that my summer should have gone differently.
Stacy:	I'm sorry you were forced to come here.
Me: 	It's okay. I'm enjoying myself, now.
Me: 	Especially because of you.
Stacy:	Oh, thank you again.
Stacy:	And... good night.
Stacy:	M-my ashen prince.
Me: 	Anytime, Stacy.
Me: 	Night.
Me: 	I really need to get some sleep...
Me: 	And, I'll need a lot of coffee tomorrow morning...
Narr:	Despite your best efforts to calm your mind before sleep,
Narr:	The fresh interaction with Stacy stirred something in your mind.
Me: 	(How did I...)
Me: 	(There she is!)
Me: 	(I need to...)
Stacy:	*Unintelligible muttering*
Me: 	(What's she saying?)
Me: 	(I can't... I can't hear her.)
Me: 	(Shit! I can't lose her this time.)
Me: 	(How is she so fast?)
Me: 	(I have to keep going!)
Me: 	(Where am I?)
Me: 	(How did I...)
Me: 	(Stacy!)
Narr:	You muster up all the energy you can to call out to Stacy.
Me: 	Stacy!
Me: 	(Dammit.)
Me: 	(Come on... I just want to help--)
Me: 	(I just...)
Me: 	(Want to know...)
Me: 	(What's wrong...)
Me: 	(With you.)
