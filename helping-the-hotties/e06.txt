Me: EMILY?!
Narator: Suddenly, the silhouette that was standing in the door, vanishes.
Me: (I'm certain I closed that door...)
Me: (Someone {i}was{/i} watching... and it looked like Emily.)
Me: (I need to go investigate, quickly!)
Me: (Otherwise she'll get away!)
    Stacy: [m!ct]... what's wrong?
    Me: Stacy...
    Me: You might not believe me, but someone was watching us.
    Me: Just now, and maybe the whole time we were...
    Stacy: Is that so? 
    Stacy: A phantom hiding in the doorway like a buried ember under fresh ashes?
    Me: Yeah...
    Stacy: So, are you ready to reignite the fire?
    Me: Stacy, I'm sorry...
    Me: I {i}really{/i} need to go see who that was.
    Stacy: Please, stay with me just a little longer...
    Narator: Stacy attempts to seduce you, but your mind is preoccupied...
    Narator: Pangs of dread coalesce in the pit of your stomach.
    Me: I'm sorry.
    Me: We really can't.
    Me: You also need to get back to your cabin.
    Me: So nobody suspects anything.
    Stacy: Of course, my enkindled prince.
    Stacy: But... Will you be a gentleman and escort me back to my cabin?
    Me: I can escort you to the front door, but I can't go any further.
    Stacy: That's a shame. But, it is understandable.
    Stacy: We're being {i}quite{/i} naughty, sneaking around like this.
    Stacy: I feel the sparks of excitement bouncing around in my heart...
    Stacy: So, I can't say I don't cherish this.
    Me: You know, I'd have to agree with you there, Stacy.
    Me: *Whispers* This way, m'lady.
    Narator: You take Stacy by the hand.
    Narator: Like a ninja turned gentleman, you sneakily escort her downstairs.
    Me: *Whisper* Step quietly...
    Stacy: *Whisper* I'll step softly, like ash.
    Narator: You quickly make it to the front door with Stacy.
    Narator: Taking great care, you open the door as quietly as possible.
    Me: *Whisper* Almost there...
    Narator: Once it's open, you usher Stacy out the door courteously.
    Me: *Whisper* After you.
    Stacy: *Whisper* You truly are a man of noble ash.
    Narator: You follow Stacy outside.
    Narator: Gently closing the front door, you find yourself on the porch with Stacy.
    Me: Stacy, I had a wonderful time tonight.
    Stacy: As did I. You pleasantly surprised me.
    Stacy: I pray we dance like rising sparks again in the future.
    Me: I'm looking forward to it.
    Narator: Stacy gives you a gentle kiss on the cheek before wishing you goodnight.
    Stacy: Good night, [m!t].
    Me: Good night, Stacy.
    Me: (I {i}really{/i} have to go look for Emily, now.)
    Me: Hmm... (Where should the search begin?)
            Me: Hmm... (Where should the search begin?)
    Narator: You approach the girls' campground.
    Narator: The night is quiet and still.
    Me: (Sounds like everyone is asleep.)
    Narator: A rush of curiosity flows through you.
    Me: (Hmm... Could Emily have snuck into one of the cabins?)
    Me: (It sounds implausible... but...)
    Me: (I'll just take a quick peek into each cabin.)
    Me: (Nobody will know.)
    Narator: You sneak up to the perimeter of Cabin 1.
    Narator: Poking your head up, over the window's edge... 
    Narator: You take a look inside.
    Me: (It's dark, but it looks like...)
    Narator: You see two silhouettes in their beds, inside the cabin.
    Me: (Hmm... I really can't see much.)
    Me: (But, it looks like Violet and Naomi are sleeping.)
    Me: (And, Emily isn't in there.)
    Me: (I should look for her somewhere else.)
    Narator: You sneak up to the perimeter of Cabin 2.
    Me: (I really need to be careful...)
    Narator: Poking your head up cautiously...
    Narator: You take a look inside.
    Me: (It's dark, but it looks like...)
    Narator: You see two silhouettes in their beds, inside the cabin.
    Me: (Hmm... I can't see much.)
    Me: (But, it looks like Stacy and Belle are sleeping.)
    Me: (And, Emily isn't in there.)
    Me: (I better get out of here...
    Me: (Before Belle's [m!t]-sense starts tingling.)
    Me: (I should look for Emily somewhere else.)
    Me: (Well.)
    Me: (I didn't find her at the campground...)
    Me: (Which means there's only one place Emily could be...)
    Me: (Hiding out at the gazebo.)
    Narator: You make your way to the dock.
    Narator: Realizing that there isn't anyone here...
    Narator: ...you look out, over the lake.
    Me: (Hmm. Nobody here.)
    Me: (Nobody over there, either.)
    Me: (But... what's this?)
    Me: (Reflections of stars?)
    Narator: What you once believed to be the reflection of stars...
    Narator: ...actually turns out to be a swarm of fireflies.
    Narator: Fireflies gracefully floating above the surface of the lake.
    Me: (Oh my god...)
    Me: (They're fireflies.)
    Me: (Wow...)
    Narator: You live in that beautiful moment...
    Me: *Deep inhale*
    Narator: ...for as long as you can.
    Me: *Deep exhale*
    Me: (I need to take a mental snapshot of this.)
    Me: (It's rare to see something like this, these days...)
    Narator: Shortly later, you take your leave.
    Me: (Well.)
    Me: (I didn't find Emily here.)
    Me: (Instead, I found something... {i}amazing{/i}.)
    Me: (Hmm... Since I've been here, I haven't seen anyone by the campsite.)
    Me: (Which means there's only one place Emily could be...)
    Me: (Hiding out at the gazebo.)
    Narator: Upon approaching the gazebo...
    Narator: You spot someone sitting there in the darkness...
    Me: (Is that Emily?)
    Me: (It is!)
    Narator: Getting even closer to the gazebo, you hear crying.
    Me: (Is Emily... crying?)
    Me: Uhh... Hey, Em.
    Narator: Realizing she's no longer alone, Emily looks shocked.
    Emily: *Sniff* Hey, [m!t]. What's... up?
    Me: Uhh... Not much.
    Me: Are you okay?
        Emily: Yeah, I'm fine. Why do you ask?
            Emily: Crying? No way. I just have allergies...
                Emily: Crying? No way. I just have allergies...
                    Me: Sure, allergies are awful. Uhh... Can I ask you something?
                        Emily: Sure... what is it?
                            Me: Did you peek into my bedroom before coming out here?
                            Me: Do you know... Who tied me up the other night?
            Emily: It's nighttime. You probably heard an animal...
                Emily: It's nighttime. You probably heard an animal...
                    Me: Yeah... Must have been. Uhh... Can I ask you something?
                        Emily: Sure... What is it?
                            Me: Did you peek into my bedroom before coming out here?
                            Me: Do you know... Who tied me up the other night?
    Emily: No way! I wouldn't violate your privacy like that...
    Me: Really?
    Me: You've already proven you don't know what personal space is.
    Emily: Ugh! Rude!
    Me: If you weren't spying on me, why was my door open?
    Emily: Maybe you forgot to close it all the way!
    Me: No, no. I'm {i}certain{/i} I closed it...
    Emily: I can't believe you don't trust me!
    Me: That's only one reason I don't trust you...
    Me: Look, I know you tied me up the other night!
    Emily: What?! You're insane!
    Emily: You really think I'd do something like that?
    Me: So, you didn't do it?
    Me: Then, do you maybe know who {i}would{/i} do that?
    Emily: I might... 
    Emily: But, why would I tell you while you're treating me like this?
    Me: I...
    Me: *Sigh* You're right.
    Me: (I need to cool it with the \"bad cop\" schtick.)
    Emily: Is there anything you'd like to say to me?
    Me: I'm sorry for my outburst.
    Me: I'm just on edge since...
    Emily: Since someone tied you up.
    Me: I get it. And, apology accepted.
    Me: So...
    Emily: I might know something...
    Emily: Talk to me tomorrow.
    Emily: Your accusations exhausted me.
    Me: Oh, come on...
    Emily: Nope.
    Emily: If you want to know, we can talk in the morning.
    Emily: Okay?
    Me: Sure...
    Emily: Night, then.
    Me: Night.
    Narator: You sit at the gazebo as Emily leaves back toward the house.
    Narator: The mystery hijacks your mind once more.
    Me: *Sigh* (I really shouldn't have sprung that accusation on her.)
    Me: (Maybe I would have learned more...)
    Me: (Oh well. I just need to wait until tomorrow.)
    Me: *Yawn*
    Me: (My bed is waiting.)
    Emily: Do I know...
    Emily: {i}What{/i}?!
    Emily: Hmm... Actually...
    Me: You do know something?
    Emily: I might not know exactly...
    Emily: But, I have my suspicions.
    Emily: (That {i}bitch{/i}...)
    Me: Well, can you spill the beans already?
    Emily: Ugh... Fine.
    Emily: Since you're so stubborn--
    Emily: But, I don't want to come off as a snitch...
    Emily: So, I'll just tell you this.
    Me: Tell me what?
    Emily: Well...
    Emily: There is someone at camp who would want to do that.
    Me: I'm aware...
    Emily: Someone {i}close{/i} to you.
    Me: (I've already investigated so many people...)
    Me: (I must have missed something...)
    Me: (After all...)
    Me: (My deductive reasoning skills have been failing me recently.)
    Emily: *Giggle* Got some gears turning?
    Me: Yeah. Thanks, Em.
    Me: I think I'm gonna head back to bed.
    Emily: Okay, I'll stay out here a little bit longer.
    Emily: [m!t]...
    Emily: Don't worry about me.
    Emily: I'll be okay.
    Me: Okay. Good night, Emily.
    Emily: Night, [m!t].
    Narator: As you walk away from the gazebo...
    Narator: The mystery consumes your mind once more.
    Me: (I really need to sleep on this new information.)
    Emily: *Sigh* I'm just tired of feeling like a ghost.
    Emily: Even though I spend my summers here, trying to help.
    Emily: I'm invisible to her.
    Me: Emily... Do you really feel that way?
    Emily: Yes!
    Emily: And I'm tired of it.
    Emily: Kiara is her golden {i}girl{/i}.
    Emily: While I'm just seen as the {i}little girl{/i}.
    Me: I'm sorry for not making you feel more seen.
    Emily: It's okay. What can I expect from someone who's barely here?
    Me: I'd be here more often if I could.
    Emily: *Sniff* I know...
    Emily: I just hope we have more time to hang out.
    Me: We will...
    Me: Actually... Do you want to help me investigate something?
    Emily: Sure! What is it?
    Me: Did you... tie me up the other night? Out in the woods?
    Emily: *Gasp* What?! Is that your big mystery?
    Emily: You think--
    Emily: Nooooo. No way!
    Me: So, you {i}didn't{/i} do that?
    Emily: Why would you think I'd do something like that?
    Me: I just thought...
    Emily: You thought I wanted to spend time with you so badly...
    Emily: ...that I'd resort to tying you down...
    Emily: ...to make sure you didn't get away?
    Me: When you say it like that it sounds kinda dumb.
    Emily: *Giggle* Yeah, it sounds {i}real{/i} dumb.
    Me: I get it, I'm not always the sharpest tool in the shed...
    Emily: Aww... Here, I can give you some help.
    Emily: You know...
    Emily: There {i}is{/i} someone at camp who would want to do something like that.
    Emily: Someone whose name starts with a...
    Emily: \"K.\"
    Me: Kiara was one of my main suspects...
    Emily: Then, it looks like you need to talk to {i}her{/i}.
    Emily: (Kiara is so... Urgh!)
    Me: It looks like I do.
    Emily: I think I'm going to head back to bed, now.
    Emily: I'm getting tired.
    Emily: (Especially of this conversation...)
    Me: Okay, I'll stay out here a bit longer.
    Me: You gonna be okay?
    Emily: Yeah, I'll be fine.
    Emily: Thanks for listening to me, [m!t].
    Me: Anytime. Good night, Em.
    Emily: Night, [m!t].
    Narator: As Emily walks away from the gazebo...
    Narator: The mystery consumes your mind once more.
    Narator: You think about it a bit longer...
    Narator: Eventually, you stand up and head back to the house.
    Me: (I really need to sleep on this new information.)
    Narator: You quickly pull your pants up.
    Narator: Not a few seconds later, you exit your room.
    Me: (Shit!)
    Me: (Who the hell was that?!)
    Me: (It looked like Emily... It had to have been her.)
    Me: (But... why?)
    Me: (Was she watching me... jacking off?)
    Me: *Shudders* (Goddamn it... I have to go investigate this.)
    Me: (I couldn't really tell what she was doing...)
    Me: (It looked like... No. It couldn't have been.)
    Me: (If I waste any more time, she'll get away!)
    Me: (Where did she go?)
    Narator: Hearing a noise downstairs, you quickly follow its source.
    Me: (Downstairs!)
    Narator: Upon arriving downstairs, you don't see the elusive peeper.
    Me: (Where did she go?)
    Me: (She's definitely not inside...)
    Me: (But, I didn't see her go out the front door.)
    Narator: At that moment, you feel a slight draft coming from behind you.
    Me: (It sure is chilly...)
    Me: (Aha! She must have gone that way.)
    Narator: Realizing she went out the back door, toward the deck, you follow.
    Me: (Was it really Emily? It sure looked like her...)
    Me: (But it was pretty dark...)
    Narator: You enter the Community Area, but see nobody in the room.
    Narator: Once again, you have a hunch she escaped out the back door.
    Me: (So weird... It looked like her hands were...)
    Me: (Was she {i}actually{/i}... No, no way.)
    Me: (I really don't need that on my mind right now.)
    Narator: You exit through the back door of the Community Area.
    Narator: Arriving at the deck, you look around...
    Me: (I wonder where she--)
    Narator: Almost immediately, you spot Emily trying to hide behind the furniture.
    Me: Uhh...
    Me: Emily? What are you doing?
    Emily: Oh! Hey [m!t], I was just...
    Emily: Uh... Just looking for something I left out here.
    Me: (She's a terrible bluffer...)
    Emily: Here it is! My favorite... leaf.
    Narator: Sensing Emily's nervousness, you jump in to calm the situation.
    Me: Relax, Emily...
    Emily: (Crap, he must have seen me...)
    Me: I just came out here for some air.
    Me: (I finally have her where I want her...)
    Me: (I CAN FINALLY GET SOME ANSWERS!)
    Me: Really is nice out here, so late at night.
    Emily: Yep, it's really peaceful.
    Me: Uh... So, how have you been?
    Emily: Good.
    Me: What were you up to before you came out here?
    Me: Something wake you up?
    Emily: I have a hard time falling asleep, sometimes.
    Emily: *Nervous chuckle* Guess it's just one of those nights.
    Me: Emily... Can I ask you something?
        Emily: Uhh... Sure, [m!t]. What is it?
                Emily: Maybe... Maybe I have been, a little.
                        Emily: Well... I have a secret.
                                Emily: Well... What do I get for telling you?
                                        Emily: I waaaant... To spend more time with you.
                            Me: I bet I know what it is. You tied me up the other night!
                        Emily: Sure... What is it?
                            Me: Do you know who tied me up the other night?
                            Me: Were you watching me through the crack in my door?
                Emily: How could I have been watching you, if I was out here, silly?
                    Me: Look, I know you just got out here. Give me a break Em...
                        Emily: Oh, okay. I did... see you. But, it was an accident!
                            Me: Sure. Accidents happen. Was the other night also an accident?
                                Emily: Accident? The other night? What are you talking about?
                                    Me: You know what I'm talking about! You tied me up!
                                    Me: So, you didn't \"accidentally\" tie me up the other night?
                            Me: If it WAS an accident... why did I see you... touching yourself?
                    Me: Suuuuure... That leaf was really important, right?
                        Emily: Yep! He's my favorite... leaf. His name is Leafy.
                            Me: Leafy, huh? I knew a guy with a similar name a while back.
                                Emily: Did you? That's craaaazy. Is there something else? I'd like to go back to bed.
                                    Me: Yeah, there was one other thing... Did you tie me up the other night?
                                    Me: Does Leafy know... who tied me up the other night?
    Emily: I don't like how you're talking to me, [m!t]...
    Me: I don't like that someone tied me up!
    Emily: ([m!ct] really is bothered by this...)
    Narator: Despite her initial fright, Emily smirks...
    Narator: Shifting the tone of their conversation.
    Emily: I might know {i}something{/i}...
    Me: I'd {i}really{/i} appreciate it if you told me, Em...
    Emily: I don't want to come off as a snitch...
    Emily: So, I'll tell you {i}this{/i}.
    Me: Tell me what?
    Emily: Well...
    Emily: There {i}is{/i} someone at camp who would want to do that.
    Me: I'm aware...
    Emily: Someone {i}close{/i} to you.
    Me: (I've already investigated so many people...)
    Me: (I must have missed something...)
    Me: (After all...)
    Me: (my deductive reasoning skills have been failing me recently.)
    Emily: *Giggle* Got some gears turning?
    Me: Yeah. Thanks, Em.
    Me: And, sorry for scaring you.
    Emily: It's okay. (I know you're the one who's {i}really{/i} scared here.)
    Emily: Anyway, I'm gonna head back to bed.
    Emily: Night!
    Me: Good night, Em.
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside, collecting your thoughts.
    Narator: The mystery consumes your mind once more.
    Me: (I really need to sleep on this new information.)
    Emily: Okay, pinkie promise?
    Me: Pinkie promise.
    Emily: Well...
    Emily: The secret is...
    Emily: There's someone at camp...
    Emily: Who's secretly obsessed with you.
    Me: Obsessed?
    Emily: Someone {i}close{/i} to you.
    Emily: Someone... Who did something to you the other night.
    Me: I could have guessed that...
    Emily: Someone whose name starts with a...
    Emily: \"K.\"
    Me: Kiara was one of my main suspects...
    Emily: Then, it looks like you need to talk to {i}her{/i}.
    Emily: (Kiara is so... Urgh!)
    Me: It looks like I do.
    Emily: I think I'm going to head back to bed, now.
    Emily: I'm getting tired.
    Emily: (Especially of this conversation...)
    Me: Yeah, it's getting late.
    Emily: Remember our pinkie promise, okay?
    Me: I will.
    Me: Good night, Em.
    Emily: Night-night!
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside, collecting your thoughts.
    Narator: The mystery hijacks your mind once more.
    Me: *Sigh* (How am I going to get a confession out of Kiara?)
    Me: *Yawn*
    Me: (I'll figure that out tomorrow.)
    Emily: No way!
    Emily: I wasn't watching you... I swear!
    Me: Then how was my door even open?
    Emily: It was open when I walked by.
    Emily: I looked in to see if you were asleep...
    Emily: Maybe you didn't close your door all the way, and it opened.
    Me: Convenient excuse...
    Emily: It's not an excuse, it's the truth!
    Me: Ahem. So, you came out here out of embarrassment?
    Emily: Yeah...
    Emily: Can I go back to sleep, now?
    Me: Sure, sure...
    Me: (I'll need to ask her more, tomorrow.)
    Me: (She has to know who tied me up...)
    Emily: Well, goodnight.
    Me: Goodnight, Emily.
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside, collecting your thoughts.
    Me: *Sigh* (I had a great opportunity to get the truth out of Emily...)
    Me: (But, I wasted it asking the wrong questions.)
    Me: (What does Emily know?)
    Me: *Yawn*
    Me: (I'll figure that out tomorrow.)
    Narator: Emily holds the leaf to her ear, pretending that she's listening.
    Emily: Mhm. Aha. Okay. You really think we should tell him?
    Me: (Has she gone full druid?)
    Emily: Okay, Leafy says we should tell you.
    Emily: There's someone at camp...
    Emily: Who's secretly obsessed with you.
    Me: Obsessed?
    Emily: Someone close to you.
    Emily: Someone... Who did something to you the other night.
    Me: I could have guessed that.
    Emily: Someone whose name starts with a...
    Emily: \"K.\"
    Me: Kiara was one of my main suspects...
    Emily: Then, it looks like you need to talk to {i}her{/i}.
    Emily: Leafy says Kiara sucks.
    Me: *Chuckle* Does he now?
    Emily: *Giggle* Yeah.
    Emily: He also says it's getting late.
    Emily: I think I'm going to head back to bed, now.
    Emily: I'm getting tired.
    Me: Yeah, I'm gonna head to bed soon, too.
    Emily: Night-night!
    Me: Night, Em.
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside, collecting your thoughts.
    Narator: The mystery hijacks your mind once more.
    Me: *Sigh* (How am I going to get a confession out of Kiara?)
    Me: *Yawn*
    Me: (I'll figure that out tomorrow.)
    Emily: *Giggle* What? Is {i}that{/i} what this is about?
    Emily: And you think--
    Emily: Nooooo. No way!
    Me: So, you {i}didn't{/i} do that?
    Emily: Why would you think I'd do something like that?
    Me: I just thought...
    Emily: You thought I wanted to spend time with you so badly...
    Emily: ...that I'd resort to tying you down...
    Emily: ...to make sure you didn't get away?
    Me: When you say it like that it sounds {i}kinda{/i} dumb.
    Emily: *Giggle* Yeah, it sounds {i}real{/i} dumb.
    Me: I get it, I'm not always the sharpest tool in the shed...
    Emily: Aww... Here, I can give you some help.
    Emily: You know... there is someone at camp who would want to do that.
    Me: I'm aware...
    Emily: Someone close to you.
    Me: (I've already investigated so many people...)
    Me: (I must have missed something...)
    Me: (After all...)
    Me: (My deductive reasoning skills have been failing me recently.)
    Emily: *Giggle* Got some gears turning?
    Me: Yeah. Thanks, Em.
    Emily: Anyway, I'm gonna head back to bed.
    Emily: Night!
    Me: Goodnight, Em.
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside, collecting your thoughts.
    Narator: The mystery consumes your mind once more.
    Me: (I really need to sleep on this new information.)
    Emily: Enough for {i}you{/i} isn't enough for {i}me{/i}.
    Emily: When you're off at college, it's {i}so{/i} boring here.
    Emily: And then, you come back for such a short amount of time...
    Me: Emily...
    Emily: It's just not fair.
    Me: You're right...
    Me: Summer goes by so fast.
    Emily: It does.
    Emily: So, you wanna know the secret?
    Me: Yeah, I do.
    Emily: Someone at camp {i}reeeeally{/i} likes you.
    Me: (Oh shit, does she know about the girls?)
    Me: And?
    Emily: It's someone close to you.
    Emily: Someone... Who did something to you the other night.
    Me: I could have guessed that.
    Emily: Think about it...
    Emily: Who knows their way around camp the best?
    Me: There are a few people...
    Emily: *Sigh* Well, just keep thinking it over.
    Emily: I'd love to spend more time with you, [m!t]...
    Emily: But, I'm getting sleepy.
    Emily: I'm gonna head off to bed.
    Emily: Night-night!
    Me: Night, Em.
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside, collecting your thoughts.
    Narator: The mystery hijacks your mind once more.
    Me: *Sigh* (Is it really who I think it is?)
    Me: (I'll have to get a confession out of her, though.)
    Me: *Yawn*
    Me: (I'll figure that out tomorrow.)
    Emily: What the hell are you talking about?!
    Me: I think you know what I'm talking about.
    Emily: I might, but why would I tell you what I know...
    Emily: ...after you accuse me like that?
    Me: I...
    Me: *Sigh* You're right.
    Me: (I need to cool it with the \"bad cop\" schtick.)
    Emily: Is there anything you'd like to say to me?
    Me: I'm sorry for my outburst.
    Me: I've just been so on edge since--
    Emily: Since someone tied you up.
    Emily: I get it. And, apology accepted.
    Me: So...
    Emily: I might know {i}something...{/i}
    Emily: ...but, that will have to wait.
    Emily: Talk to me tomorrow.
    Emily: This accusation exhausted me.
    Me: Oh come on...
    Emily: Nope.
    Emily: If you really wanna know, then we can talk in the morning.
    Emily: Okay?
    Me: Sure...
    Emily: Night, then.
    Me: Night.
    Narator: You spend a bit more time outside... 
    Narator: Collecting your thoughts.
    Narator: The mystery hijacks your mind once more.
    Me: *Sigh* (I really shouldn't have sprung that accusation on her.)
    Me: (Maybe I would have learned more...)
    Me: (Oh well. I just need to wait until tomorrow.)
    Me: *Yawn*
    Me: (My bed is waiting.)
    Narator: Emily goes pale as her face contorts into a look of abject horror.
    Emily: What?! YOU'RE CRAZY!
    Me: Emily... I--
    Emily: NO! How could you say that?!
    Emily: (Did he really see me?)
    Narator: In a flash, Emily runs through the back door, disappearing from sight.
    Me: (Maybe I shouldn't have been so blunt...)
    Narator: Emily ran through the house, quickly arriving in her room.
    Emily: (What's wrong with me? Why was I...)
    Narator: Emily buried her head in her pillow, letting out a few conflicted tears.
    Narator: Standing on the deck, you take a deep breath of the fresh nighttime air.
    Me: *Sigh* (I should be nicer to her tomorrow...)
    Me: (Otherwise, I'll never figure out what happened that night.)
Narator: Now back in your room after your late-night talk with Emily...
Narator: You immediately hop into bed.
Me: *Yawn* (I'm exhausted.)
Me: (Another long night is over.)
Me: (And, tomorrow will be a long day, I'm sure of that.)
Narator: As you think about tomorrow, your eyelids grow heavier.
Me: *Yawn*
Narator: Your thoughts slow as sleep takes you.
Narator: You sleep like a log through the night.
Narator: Awoken by the morning sunlight, you feel well-rested.
Me: *Yawn* I feel...
Me: Surprisingly great, actually.
Me: I finally got a good night's sleep.
Me: (Pretty easy when Eve isn't assigning me early-bird chores...)
Narator: You get dressed and make your way onto the landing.
Me: (Hmm... It doesn't sound like anyone else is up yet.)
Me: (What time is it anyway?)
Narator: Continuing downstairs, and walking into the kitchen, you're greeted by...
Narator: ...an empty room.
Me: (I guess everybody is sleeping in.)
Me: (Is there any coffee?)
Narator: You go over to the coffee maker, noticing the empty pot.
Me: (Guess not.)
Me: (Looks like Eve is still asleep too.)
Me: (That is a bit strange for Eve...)
Me: (Ah, whatever.)
Me: (I guess everybody needs their beauty sleep sometimes.)
Narator: Your focus returns to the coffee machine.
Me: (Guess I better make the coffee myself.)
Narator: You push the button, and coffee begins dripping into the pot.
Me: (Oh thank Christ, the machine was pre-loaded.)
Me: (I've been gone so long...)
Me: (...I have no idea where they keep the coffee, now.)
Me: (I probably would've gone coffee-less if it wasn't waiting, ready to go.)
Me: (Thanks, Eve.)
Narator: The coffee machine stops whirring.
Narator: And, the red indicator light turns off.
Me: Coffee time.
Narator: You pour yourself a hot cup of coffee.
Me: Mmm. Smells delicious.
Narator: Sipping your coffee, you gaze out the window.
Narator: Questions about your investigation cross your mind.
Me: (I need to solve this thing...)
Me: (...so I can finally move on.)
Narator: Suddenly, Kiara shows up in the kitchen.
Narator: Interrupting your contemplation.
Kiara: Morning, [m!t]!
Me: Ah!
Me: *Chuckle* You surprised me, Kiara.
Kiara: Looks like you were lost in thought.
Kiara: Or, is the coffee just {i}that good{/i}?
Narator: Kiara goes over to the pot, and helps herself to a cup of joe.
Narator: As she does...
Narator: You consider asking her about the rope under her bed.
Me: (This is my chance to--)
Narator: Unfortunately, your moment is spoiled by Eve.
Eve: Good morning, you two.
Me: Morning, Eve.
Kiara: Morning!
Me: (She always shows up at the worst time...)
Narator: Eve swiftly makes her way to the fridge.
Narator: She takes out some yogurt and fruit.
Eve: A quick breakfast this morning.
Narator: Not a moment later, Emily arrives in the kitchen.
Narator: She still seems like she's waking up.
Emily: *Yawn* Morning, peeps.
Eve: Peeps? Morning, Emily.
Narator: Emily looks over at you and smiles.
Narator: She then shifts her gaze to Kiara and makes a face.
Kiara: Hmph.
Eve: Everybody, grab some coffee and breakfast.
Eve: We'll be starting soon.
Narator: Everybody grabs some fruit and yogurt.
Narator: And those who haven't already poured themselves coffee, now do.
Narator: Sitting at the table, now, everyone waits for Eve to begin.
Eve: Okay. Thanks everyone.
Eve: Good morning, again.
Eve: Today is another big day...
Eve: The patients will be busy, most of the day...
Eve: But, we will have a bit of a shindig this evening.
Eve: We're going to have a barbecue this evening.
Eve: However, that's the bookend for a day of intensive therapy.
Me: (What the hell is Eve going to do to them?)
Kiara: Intensive?
Emily: Sounds stressful.
Eve: Well, for some patients it may be.
Eve: I suppose...
Eve: That all depends on the results of their pre-evaluations. 
Eve: That's the first course of action.
Eve: Throughout the day they'll have individual therapy...
Eve: Determined by the results of their pre-evaluations.
Eve: Does that make sense to you guys?
Eve: Mostly, the task will be escorting them here and there.
Eve: Kiara. You'll go to the city to get things for the barbecue.
Eve: Emily, and [m!t]...
Eve: You'll be in charge of accompanying the girls, today.
Me: (Are we really just glorified chauffers?)
Eve: Does everyone understand their tasks?
Me: Yes.
Emily: Yep, all clear.
Kiara: Toss me the keys, and I'll be on my way.
Narator: Eve tosses the keys to Kiara...
Narator: She catches them gracefully, and slips them into her pocket.
Me: (Damn, she's good.)
Narator: Kiara stands up from her seat at the table.
Kiara: See you guys later.
Kiara: I shouldn't be gone too long.
Narator: She smiles at you while walking toward the front door.
Me: See you.
Emily: Hrmph.
Eve: Please don't crash the car...
Kiara: That's something [m!t] would do, not me!
Me: Ha-ha... (She sure is playing it cool...)
Me: (If she's hiding anything, she's hiding it well.)
Eve: You two.
Eve: Please, go get the girls and bring them back here.
Emily: Where?
Eve: Out behind the Community Area, to the deck.
Emily: Okay! See ya soon.
Eve: You better get going too, [m!t].
Me: I was just about to.
Me: See you soon.
Eve: Bye, [m!t].
Narator: You stand up from your seat at the table,
Narator: and head for the front door.
    Narator: Approaching Emily...
    Narator: She suddenly grabs your wrist, and skips out the front door...
    Narator: ...yanking you with her.
    Me: Hey!
    Emily: *Giggle* There's no time to waste!
    Narator: Emily keeps yanking your wrist while dragging you onto the path.
    Narator: Out on the path, you break her hold on your wrist.
    Me: (Ouch, she gave me an Indian burn...)
    Me: Why are you so excited all of a sudden?
    Emily: Because I get to hang with you!
    Emily: (And because {i}she's{/i} gone.)
    Me: So, uhh...
    Me: You sleep well?
    Emily: Thanks for asking. I did, actually.
    Emily: Especially after our conversation.
    Narator: Emily winks at you, smiling.
    Me: *Chuckle* What's that supposed to mean?
    Emily: It means we'll solve this...
    Emily: We'll get the evidence to catch \"K.\"
    Me: I'm sure we will... partner.
    Narator: Emily's eyes light up upon hearing this.
    Narator: She smiles and skips the rest of the way to the campground.
    Narator: Soon, both of you arrive at the girls' campground.
    Emily: We're here!
    Narator: Emily skips ahead of you, toward the cabins.
    Narator: As you follow Emily, she keeps her distance.
    Me: Em, wait up!
    Narator: Outside on the path, Emily keeps walking ahead of you.
    Narator: However, you pick up the pace and catch up to her.
    Me: Emily...
    Me: Are you still upset about last night?
    Emily: Hrmph. What if I am?
    Me: You can't stay mad at me forever...
    Emily: So I should just stop right now?
    Emily: Letting you off the hook so easily?
    Me: I really didn't mean anything by it, Emily...
    Me: I was just confused.
    Emily: You sure are confused a lot...
    Me: Maybe I got hit in the head too many times playing sports.
    Emily: *Giggle* That would explain it...
    Narator: You and Emily walk quietly the rest of the way.
    Narator: However, by the time you arrive at the campground...
    Narator: She seems more cheerful.
    Me: (Is she faking it, or did she forgive me?)
    Narator: Emily walks ahead of you, toward the girls' cabins.
    Narator: Emily waits for you at the door.
    Emily: Let's get to it, [m!t].
    Narator: She leads the way outside.
    Narator: Out on the path, you begin to chat.
    Me: How'd you sleep?
    Emily: Good. You?
    Me: I actually feel really well-rested.
    Emily: Maybe because you feel like...
    Emily: You're getting close to solving the mystery?
    Me: Maybe...
    Me: But, I {i}was{/i} wondering...
    Me: Can you give me any more hints?
        Emily: Maybe I can. What's on your mind?
                Emily: I did... So close they sleep under the same roof as you.
                Emily: Finally asking the right questions! No, they're not.
    Emily: Bingo!
    Narator: Emily claps for your successful deduction.
    Me: Hey... Don't patronize me!
    Me: I just wanted to be certain...
    Emily: For the sake of your ego, I'll believe you.
    Narator: Soon, both of you arrive at the girls' campground.
    Narator: Emily walks ahead of you, toward the cabins.
    Emily: *Sigh* I feel sorry for you...
    Me: Huh?
    Emily: You really {i}are{/i} a little dumb.
    Emily: Hellooooo. Anyone home?
    Me: What the hell?!
    Me: Cut it out!
    Emily: You're clearly stressed out by having to think this hard.
    Me: Keep talking like that and--
    Emily: I {i}was{/i} about to say...
    Emily: I'll tell you who it is.
    Emily: It's Kiara, silly!
    Me: So it {i}was{/i} Kiara...
    Me: I had my suspicions.
    Me: I just wanted to hear some kind of confirmation.
    Emily: And, now you have.
    Emily: Hey, [m!t].
    Me: What?
    Emily: Maybe I can teach you some of my detective skills sometime.
    Me: Why not.
    Me: (She is the original Queen of Gossip at Red Falls, after all...)
    Me: (I could learn something from her.)
    Narator: Soon, both of you arrive at the girls' campground.
    Narator: Emily walks ahead of you, toward the cabins.
Narator: Excitedly, she takes a deep breath...
Emily: *Deep inhale*
Narator: ...readying her vocal cords for the coming announcement.
Emily: GOOOOOOOOD MOOOOOORNING CHICAAAAS!!!
Emily: WAKEY WAAAAKEY!!
Narator: Soon, the girls begin emerging from their cabins.
Naomi: What the hell?!
Naomi: Why do you have to screech at us so early in the morning?
Violet: Good morning.
Belle: Heeeeey. Moooorning.
Stacy: Good morning, ashen prince.
Emily: (What did she just call him?)
Me: Good morning, girls.
Emily: Great, you're all here!
Emily: Eve told us to come get you guys,
Emily: and bring you back to the Community Area.
Narator: Displeased that the day is already starting, Naomi rolls her eyes.
Naomi: What now?
Naomi: More {i}teambuilding?{/i}
Emily: Nope! You all have to fill in some kind of questionnaire.
Emily: No clue what it is, though. Follow me!
Narator: Emily leads the girls away from the campground.
Narator: You follow at the tail end of the group.
Narator: While you all walk down the path...
Narator: ...Belle turns back and winks at you.
Belle: Hey good lookin'.
Belle: You had a good night?
Me: Huh? (Is she psychic, too?)
Belle: You seem more energetic today.
Me: Oh, yeah.
Me: I slept well.
Belle: Bet you'd sleep even better with {i}me{/i} in your bed.
Me: (Straight to the point, huh?)
Belle: On second thought...
Belle: I'd probably keep you up all night.
Me: (Of course she takes it even further...)
Me: *Chuckle* Riiight.
Naomi: You'd probably get a disease, too.
Narator: You withhold your laughter hearing that insult...
Narator: Belle glares at Naomi with an annoyed expression...
Narator: ...who glares back at her.
Me: Girls, please.
Me: Let's lighten up...
Emily: Okay! We're almost there!
Narator: Soon, you all arrive at the Community Area deck.
Narator: Eve is there, awaiting the patients' arrival.
Eve: Hello, ladies.
Eve: I hope you all slept well.
Eve: In a moment, you'll all go through pre-evaluation.
Eve: It's a simple questionnaire to calibrate your therapies.
Eve: We aim to make the experience more personal...
Eve: ...and, in turn, more effective.
Eve: So!
Eve: Let's not waste any time.
Eve: Belle. Stacy. Come with me.
Eve: [m!ct], Emily. You two keep these ladies company.
Me: Shouldn't be too hard.
Narator: As Stacy and Belle follow Eve into the house...
Narator: ...you turn your gaze to the remaining girls.
Me: So, looks like we have some time to chat.
Violet: Guess so...
Naomi: You really lucked out, didn't you?
Emily: Uhh... So...
Narator: Emily turns to Naomi, inspecting her outfit.
Emily: I like your outfit, Naomi.
Naomi: Thanks! But, I'm sorry to burst your bubble...
Naomi: It's probably out of your budget.
Emily: Oh, really?
Naomi: Yeah. It's {i}all{/i} designer.
Me: So, how much do you think your outfit costs in total?
Naomi: Oh, I don't know...
Naomi: *Laugh* I never look at price tags.
Me: You really {i}are{/i} privileged...
Narator: Emily's eyes grow wide. 
Narator: Through her dazzled astonishment, she asks Naomi a question.
Emily: Are you... an heiress?
Naomi: Hmm, I suppose I am.
Narator: Violet seems slightly annoyed by the conversation...
Violet: Can we talk about less... {i}materialistic{/i} things, please?
Naomi: Do you have something {i}better{/i} on your mind?
Violet: Not really...
Violet: Maybe [m!t] can suggest something.
    Naomi: Well, what do you want to talk about?
        Me: How is it being at camp now that a few days have passed?
            Naomi: How is it? Hot, dusty, and there are SO MANY mosquitos...
                    Naomi: Worse? How could it possibly be worse?
                        Me: You could have been forced to wear beige jumpsuits...
                            Naomi: *Gasp* You'd never!
                                    Naomi: She really is boooooring.
                                    Naomi: I think you're joking.
                        Me: Well, we're lucky to even have a lake at the campground.
                            Naomi: Yeah, without that we'd be living in squalor.
                                    Naomi: Hrmph. I guess you're right. It's not THAT bad.
                                        Me: Camping can be really fulfilling. Go to the lake one night, you'll see.
                                        Me: Huh. It looks like you're already learning Eve's lesson.
                                Me: Sorry the amenities aren't up to your standards, princess...
                Me: I'm more worried about Hector than mosquitos.
                    Naomi: You're still thinking about Hector? I made that story up.
                        Me: *Chuckle* You did? Sorry, but I don't believe you.
                            Naomi: What, a girl can't write horror?
                            Naomi: Thanks. I was inspired while writing it.
                                Me: You know, you might have a future in writing, Naomi.
                                Me: (That'll settle my worries about Hector roaming around.)
        Me: Violet, what do you like to wear when you go out?
            Violet: What do I wear? Well...
                    Violet: I'd rather not talk about my personal life...
                        Me: You're right. We shouldn't have been so persistent.
                        Me: Oh, come on. Everybody else is open to sharing...
                    Violet: If you promise... I like to wear elegant black dresses.
                            Violet: *Chuckle* No, no. No shoulder-pads, either.
                                    Violet: It's something else... Silkier, and form-fitting.
                                        Me: Oh, wow... That sounds really elegant, actually.
                                        Me: Well... I think that settles it. The opposite of what I thought.
                                Me: *Chuckle* Right, so no frills. Looks like we got our answer.
                            Violet: Yeah, something more along those lines. Black, form-fitting.
                                Me: Wow, that actually does sound pretty... elegant.
Naomi: You're too sweet, [m!t].
Naomi: (Does he really like my story?)
Naomi: (...)
Me: I mean it. Just keep at it.
Narator: Naomi smiles at you with genuine kindness.
Narator: It's the first time you've seen that from her since she got to camp.
Me: (I guess she {i}does{/i} care about something.)
Me: (Who knew it'd be creative writing...)
Me: So, Naomi... You have any other story ideas?
Naomi: Well... Red Falls has given me {i}some{/i} ideas.
Narator: Shortly after Naomi responds...
Narator: Naomi doesn't look pleased hearing your pointed remarks.
Naomi: You're really making a habit out of being a douche...
Naomi: Aren't you?
Me: I'm only following {i}your{/i} lead.
Naomi: Hrmph.
Narator: Naomi gets quiet, visibly annoyed by your behavior.
Me: (Shit, I think I took it too far...)
Narator: Shortly after Naomi goes quiet...
Narator: You enjoy a bit more chit-chat with the girls.
Me: Hmm...
Me: I wonder when Stacy and Belle will be done.
Narator: Shortly after you speak, almost as if you summoned them...
Narator: Violet gets visibly uncomfortable by your pushing...
Violet: Uhh... Can...
Violet: Can we just change the subject, {i}please?{/i}
Naomi: [m!ct], how could {i}she{/i} possibly wear anything elegant?
Naomi: I mean, have {i}you{/i} ever seen anyone lifting weights in a dress?
Violet: *Gasp*
Me: Well...
Naomi: Come on, have you?
Me: ...n-no, I haven't.
Violet: You're such a relentless witch!
Naomi: And you're a--
Narator: As Naomi was about to speak...
Narator: Violet appears flattered.
Violet: Well... Thank you, [m!t].
Me: No problem, I'm just being honest...
Violet: (He's such a gentleman...)
Narator: Shortly after your flirtatious response...
Narator: ...Eve and the first group come back outside, onto the deck.
Belle: Miss me, [m!t]?
Me: (Not particularly.)
Me: Hey, Belle.
Eve: Well, that's it for our first group's pre-evaluations.
Eve: [m!ct], Emily. You know what to do. 
Eve: Keep these young ladies company.
Eve: Naomi and Violet, please follow me.
Narator: Eve, followed by Naomi and Violet, go inside quickly.
Narator: You and Emily are left on the deck with Belle and Stacy.
Stacy: Hello, [m!t].
Me: Hi, Stacy. How was the pre-evaluation?
Stacy: It was quite fine.
Stacy: Although, I still don't get why there were so few questions about fire.
Belle: *Giggle* And, very few questions about {i}sex{/i}.
Me: (Huh, that is a bit weird.)
Me: (Why not ask the flame fanatic about fire?)
Me: (Or the nympho about sex?)
Narator: You spend a few moments lost in thought.
Belle: Hmm... It looks like [m!t] might need to fill out that pre-evaluation, too.
Stacy: *Giggle* I believe you may be right, Belle.
Me: Pssht. I was just thinking.
Belle: You sure your brain isn't experiencing framerate drops?
Narator: Emily steps in, displeased by the girls' flirtatious behavior.
Emily: So! What do you gals want to talk about?
Emily: Got any juicy gossip?
Belle: Hey! {i}I was talking.{/i}
Emily: Oh, sorry! Uhh... So, {i}do you?{/i}
Belle: Well... Maybe I {i}do.{/i}
Stacy: As do I.
Me: (She better not...)
Stacy: *Whisper* The flame tells me many things.
Me: (Phew. Okay, just the usual.)
Belle: My lips are sealed...
Belle: But, maaaaybe [m!t] can unseal these lips.
Belle: (I'd love it if he opened them with something special...)
Narator: Emily, once again annoyed by Belle's flirtatiousness, asks you a question.
    Emily: So! Whose gossip do you want to hear?
            Belle: What do I wear? Well...
                    Belle: Violet, huh? Well... I know she talks in her sleep.
                            Belle: Yep. She holds full conversations with herself, sometimes.
                                    Belle: Naomi said there was one about you...
                                            Belle: Oh, got you interested?
                                                Me: You know what, never mind. I couldn't care less.
                        Me: That's not gossip... Know anything more interesting?
                            Belle: Oh, that's not good enough? Fine. Who do you want gossip on, then?
                                    Belle: *Laugh* No way, I'll tell you something better...
                                            Belle: Way better. I know that you like to jerk your long dong, in the shower.
                                                Me: Pffft. Impossible. The bathroom is on the second floor.
                                                    Belle: You're right. It's impossible... Or is it?
                                                        Me: You're the queen of the trolls. I KNOW you're bluffing.
                                        Me: You know what? I'd rather not know, actually...
                                    Belle: I know she has the hots for someone here...
                                            Belle: Oh, and why's that?
                    Belle: Naomi, huh? Well... I noticed one of her handbags wasn't actually designer.
                        Me: No way... Really? You sure you don't need glasses?
                            Belle: From what I could see, she does.
                                    Belle: Maybe she is. Maybe she doesn't know.
            Stacy: The flame accepts. Do you wish to hear a secret of ash, or fire?
                    Stacy: The ash says that someone here hides more secrets than it does.
                            Stacy: The ash has spoken. It is our secret to carry, now.
                                    Stacy: What does the ash hear?
                                        Me: Are you sure you're hearing the ash right? It really said no?
                    Stacy: The fire says that something eventful will happen at camp, soon.
                            Stacy: The flame gives what it gives. Be content. Follow the clues.
                                Me: I will walk with fire, and fire will walk with me.
                        Me: I guess we just need to follow the signs, then.
Belle: You know, [m!t]?
Belle: You're really {i}no fun.{/i}
Me: Well, that's fine.
Me: I'm not here to entertain you.
Belle: Oh, really? I thought you are.
Me: No, I'm not...
Me: *Chuckle* Despite how fun I may be to hang around with.
Belle: *Giggle* Oh, don't stroke your ego so much...
Belle: It's {i}inappropriate{/i} to stroke yourself in public.
Stacy: *Laughs*
Narator: Belle sits quietly for a moment...
Narator: ...allowing the four of you a moment of silence.
Narator: Belle goes silent for a brief moment...
Narator: ...before bursting out laughing.
Belle: Bahahahaha! {i}Really?{/i}
Belle: You know what {i}I{/i} think?
Me: What do you think, Belle?
Belle: I think you're bluffing...
Belle: And, very badly, at that.
Me: I'm not, but think whatever you want.
Belle: Okay, okay. I'll buy your excuse.
Me: (God damn she's persistent...)
Narator: Belle sits quietly for a moment...
Narator: ...allowing the four of you a moment of silence.
Narator: Stacy's face goes red.
Narator: She quickly turns away in embarrassment.
Stacy: [m!ct]! I do not appreciate you spreading such rumors...
Stacy: I... I despise such things!
Me: Belle, I was just joking...
Me: Don't think anything of my bullshittery.
Belle: Don't worry, Stacy.
Belle: What he just said is {i}clearly{/i} BS.
Stacy: (How could he!)
Stacy: (I trusted him with my soul's flame...)
Me: Stacy, I'm sorry for messing with you like that.
Me: (I really fucked up, now.)
Me: I won't do it again.
Stacy: You will need to make amends better than that, [m!t].
Stacy: For now, begone from my warmth.
Narator: Stacy's anger kills the previously light mood.
Narator: You bask in the consequences of your breach of Stacy's trust...
Narator: ...you all remain quiet for a moment...
Narator: This allows everyone a moment of calm.
Narator: Stacy scowls, before turning away from you.
Stacy: Neither I, nor the Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus appreciate your sarcasm, [m!t].
Me: (She really takes her beliefs seriously...)
Me: I'm sorry, Stacy...
Me: I should have been more respectful.
Stacy: Yes, you should have...
Stacy: Lest the flames of wrath reduce your soul to cinders as you leave this world.
Belle: *Whispers* Awkwaaaard...
Me: Jesus, Stacy...
Me: That sounds awful...
Stacy: Flames can be fickle.
Stacy: But, for now, the flame acknowledges your apology.
Narator: Stacy's response kills the previously light mood.
Narator: Basking in the consequences of your unkind comments toward Stacy...
Narator: ...you all remain quiet for a moment...
Narator: This allows everyone a moment of calm.
Narator: Stacy looks you deeply in the eyes, for a moment.
Narator: She gives you a small, kind, smile.
Stacy: [m!ct]... Your kindness is warm...
Stacy: (I feel it deep within my heart.)
Me: Uhh... Thanks, Stacy.
Stacy: The Heavenly Phoenix-Lotus shines upon you.
Belle: Do I get any phoenix-shine?
Stacy: Only time will tell, Belle.
Narator: The conversation, having nowhere to go, dies down.
Narator: This allows everyone a moment of calm.
Narator: You hear the gentle summer wind whooshing through the trees.
Narator: You breathe in deeply, enjoying the moment...
Narator: Before Belle clears her throat, in an attempt to get your attention.
Belle: Ahrm... Ahem!
Belle: Excuse me, Mr. Counselor?
Me: Belle, I'm not really a counselor...
Emily: Yeah, he's more of a {i}janitor.{/i}
Me: I'm not a janitor... I'm the camp assistant.
Belle: Okay, Mr. Camp Assistant... Can I go to the ladies' room?
Me: Uh... sure. It's upstairs.
Belle: Thank you!
Narator: In a flash, Belle runs off inside.
Belle: (Violet and Naomi must be in the office.)
Narator: She continues exploring the first floor of the house.
Narator: Making her way through the living room...
Narator: ...Belle can't help but critique the house's decor.
Belle: (This house is {i}so drab...{/i})
Narator: She goes out the other door, into the covered half-hallway...
Narator: Then, into the main house's living room.
Belle: (Where are the RGB LEDs?!)
Belle: (What did I really expect?)
Narator: Poking around the living room, Belle keeps at her relentless critique.
Belle: (There's no sense of atmosphere... no {i}mood.{/i})
Belle: (Thank god I don't have to live here...)
Narator: Belle goes upstairs, and is greeted by multiple closed doors.
Belle: ([m!ct] never said which door it was...)
Narator: Suddenly, she has a mischievious realization...
Belle: (Guess that means I gotta check them all.)
Narator: She tries the various doors, but they are all locked...
Narator: She finds the bathroom... but realizes there's one more door left unchecked.
Belle: (Well, now I'm curious what's behind door number 5...)
Narator: Trying the door, Belle is surprised when it swings open.
Belle: (Bingo!)
Belle: (Oh my...)
Belle: (What a great surprise...)
Belle: (It's [m!t]'s room!)
    Narator: Belle goes into your room without a second thought.
    Belle: (Ohohoho... What precious loot is [m!t] hiding?)
    Belle: (Some clothes...)
    Belle: (Underwear...)
    Narator: Belle continues rummaging through your belongings playfully.
    Belle: (Laptop on the desk, and--)
    Belle: (Oh? What's this?)
    Belle: (A key?)
    Belle: (I should hold on to {i}this...{/i})
    Belle: *Quiet laugh* (Maybe the key goes to the vault [m!t] hides our nudes in.)
    Belle: (Or...)
    Belle: (Maybe...)
    Belle: (Maybe it goes to one of the locked doors on this floor?)
    Belle: (I'll have to come back and check some other time.)
    Narator: Belle gives your room another good look before leaving.
    Narator: She enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her.
    Narator: Belle goes into your room without a second thought.
    Belle: (Ohohoho... What precious loot is [m!t] hiding?)
    Narator: Belle begins poking around your belongings.
    Belle: (Some clothes...)
    Belle: (Laptop on the desk...)
    Belle: (Oh? What's this?)
    Belle: (His underwear?)
    Belle: (I should hold on to these...)
    Belle: (Maybe I can show these off to the girls later.)
    Belle: (Naomi and Stacy would {i}definitely{/i} get a kick out of it...)
    Belle: *Quiet laugh* (And, it would {i}definitely{/i} make Violet uncomfortable.)
    Belle: (I love that face she makes when she's uncomfortable.)
    Belle: (It's actually kinda cute.)
    Belle: (Hmm...)
    Belle: (I'm sure there's something better hiding in here...)
    Belle: (But, I've already been gone too long.)
    Belle: (I'll have to come back and check more thoroughly some other time.)
    Narator: Belle briefly scans your room once more before leaving.
    Narator: She enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her.
Me: Ah...
Me: Hmm... What's taking Belle so long?
Emily: [m!ct], you shouldn't question why some girls take their time in the bathroom.
Me: Yeah, you're right.
Me: (I really don't want to know, anyway.)
Narator: You all hear the door swing open as Belle exits the house, onto the deck.
Belle: Are they really not done yet?
Narator: Belle wouldn't have to wonder long.
Narator: Because, shortly after, Eve emerges onto the deck with Naomi and Violet in tow.
Eve: Thank you for your patience, everyone.
Eve: That's it for the pre-evaluations.
Eve: I will need some time to prepare for your sessions, though.
Eve: So, that gives everyone a bit of free time, before we begin.
Me: Free time?
Eve: Oh, no.
Eve: Not for you, [m!t].
Eve: You'll need to help us out around the house a bit.
Eve: The ladies can spend this time however they want.
Belle: However?
Eve: Well, no. Not {i}however{/i}, Belle...
Eve: You have around a half hour or so.
Eve: Meet back here when that half hour is up, and we'll begin the sessions.
Eve: For now, enjoy, ladies!
Narator: The girls walk off, back toward the campground.
Narator: Eve ushers you both inside the Community Area.
Eve: Follow me.
Narator: You and Emily enter the house, helping Eve prepare for the coming sessions.
Narator: Unlike you, busy with your chores...
Narator: The girls seem to be having fun back at their campground.
Narator: Stacy is sitting on the stairs of her cabin.
Narator: Her eyes are closed, head tilted upwards, as she basks in the sun.
Narator: Belle is sitting next to her, sunbathing with her top off.
Narator: Leaning on the wall of her cabin, arms crossed...
Narator: Naomi looks off toward the lake, before raising her hands to her mouth.
Naomi: Viiiiioooooleeeet! Where are yoooooou?
Narator: Violet arrives from the dock, back at the campground.
Violet: I'm right here, Naomi.
Naomi: Oh, good. How was your stretch?
Violet: Uhh... It was good.
Violet: Why do you care all of a sudden?
Naomi: I don't know. I've been thinking...
Naomi: Maybe I could benefit from it, too.
Violet: Are you joking?
Naomi: *Chuckle* Of course I'm joking.
Naomi: I wouldn't want to risk wrinkling or stretching out my skin.
Violet: You know, some yoga might actually be {i}good{/i} for your precious skin.
Naomi: Oh really?
Naomi: Hmm... No thanks, I'll pass.
Stacy: Please, quiet yourselves.
Naomi: What?
Belle: She said shush. We're trying to sunbathe in peace.
Stacy: I'm not.
Stacy: I'm communing with the sun's divine flame.
Naomi: Oh, in that case, tell the sun to chill.
Naomi: It's only gotten hotter and hotter the past few days.
Stacy: Not possible...
Stacy: The sun's will is its own.
Belle: Anyway, you could benefit from some vitamin D.
Belle: *Giggle* And, some good \"D.\"
Naomi: Ha-ha. Why don't you share, then?
Naomi: Since you're just {i}swimming{/i} in the \"D.\"
Narator: Belle sticks her tongue out at Naomi, and goes back to sunbathing.
Naomi: *Yawn* I think it's time to go back to the house.
Violet: Yeah, we really shouldn't keep Dr. Eve waiting.
Narator: Displeased but cooperative, Belle and Stacy listen to Naomi's suggestion.
Narator: They walk over to Naomi, reluctantly.
Narator: Now that the girls are all together.
Narator: Naomi leads the group toward the house.
Eve: The ladies should be here any day now.
Me: Oh, has it already been 30 minutes?
Eve: Yes.
Me: Wow... Time flies, I guess.
Eve: Oh? The chores didn't bore you?
Me: I don't really mind them as much, anymore.
Eve: Well, that's wonderful, [m!t].
Eve: ([m!ct]'s maturing quite a lot this summer.)
Narator: As Eve gives you a reassuring smile, the girls come down the path.
Belle: We're heeeeere!
Eve: Hello, ladies.
Eve: Are you all ready for your therapy?
Eve: After much assessment of your pre-evaluation forms...
Eve: I have created your schedules for today.
Eve: Today, you'll be undergoing individual and personalized therapies.
Eve: In order to preserve your privacy...
Eve: I will not be discussing your therapies at this moment.
Me: (That's odd...)
Me: (What's so \"sensitive\" about these therapies?)
Belle: Ooooh... Surprise therapy?
Belle: How {i}exciting.{/i}
Eve: Actually, it's just standard therapy.
Eve: I'm just making sure you all feel as comfortable as possible.
Eve: Which is why I'm not telling everybody about each others' therapies...
Eve: Anyway.
Eve: First up is Naomi's therapy session.
Naomi: Alright, let's get this over with...
Eve: The rest of you can stay here until I return.
Eve: [m!ct], you'll need to come with us.
Me: Huh? (I wonder what this is about...)
Naomi: Why does he need to be at my session?
Naomi: I thought you said you cared about our privacy.
Eve: Your session is slightly different than the others.
Eve: [m!ct] is going to be there for support.
Me: (Support?)
Naomi: The way you're talking about this...
Naomi: I'm clearly {i}not{/i} going to like it.
Eve: It won't be so bad.
Eve: Come on, follow me.
Narator: You and Naomi follow Eve out into the woods...
Naomi: Why is my session all the way out here?
Eve: Because what you need to learn is out here.
Naomi: I really don't like where this is going...
Narator: You all soon arrive at an old camping spot.
Narator: It's overgrown with weeds and small shrubs, and blanketed in broken twigs.
Eve: Here we are.
Eve: I used to come out here to camp while it was still wild.
Eve: Ah... Good times.
Naomi: Did you just bring us out here to reminisce on your boring old stories?
Eve: *Chuckle* They're actually pretty good stories...
Eve: But, no. No, I did not.
Eve: You're out here to clear the area of the weeds and debris.
Eve: We might want to use this area again for something in the future.
Eve: And, it needs to be cleared and clean for anything to happen.
Naomi: What?!
Naomi: You're making me do your yard work?
Eve: Well, yes and no.
Eve: I'm exposing you to stimuli you interpret as... hostile.
Naomi: No way! Nope! I'm not doing this!
Eve: Stimuli that {i}clearly{/i} evoke a negative, non-cooperative response.
Eve: I think this is what you need most to develop, and overcome your... issues.
Eve: But, don't worry. You'll have a helper.
Me: Is that right?
Eve: Well, only if you agree to help Naomi out.
Eve: I can't force you to do anything.
Naomi: Wait, yes you can!
Naomi: You do it all the time!
Eve: In this situation, it's best that [m!t] chooses.
Eve: I just want to come back to some work being done.
Eve: See you soon!
Naomi: Ugh! I hate this place!
Naomi: Always making me do unnecessarily grueling activities...
Naomi: I don't see how this can help me.
Naomi: I don't even need any help!
Me: Look, Naomi...
Me: The quicker this gets done, the quicker you can leave.
Me: (Maybe if I start cleaning the area, she'll follow my lead...)
    Me: (Maybe if I start cleaning the area, she'll follow my lead...)
        Narator: You pick up the rake you saw propped-up on a wheelbarrow.
        Narator: Confident in your plan, you begin raking the area.
        Narator: Naomi looks on as you do.
        Me: (I really think my strategy will work...)
        Me: *Whistling a melody*
        Naomi: (Why is he acting so... casual?)
        Naomi: Hey...
        Naomi: Why are you doing... {i}this?{/i}
        Me: What do you mean?
        Naomi: Why are you doing the chores {i}I{/i} should be doing?
        Naomi: Doesn't that... defeat the purpose?
        Me: I mean... I don't see it like that.
        Me: Eve just wants this area cleaned up.
        Me: She doesn't need to know {i}who{/i} did the work...
        Naomi: Well...
        Naomi: I guess I shouldn't stop you, then...
        Naomi: (But, what am I supposed to do?)
        Me: If you're bored...
        Me: You can always do a little raking, and I can clear the weeds and brush.
        Narator: At first, Naomi looks appalled by the suggestion...
        Narator: However, after a bit more time spent mostly in silence, watching you rake...
        Naomi: Hey, [m!t]...
        Naomi: Hand me the rake, please.
        Me: Huh?
        Me: You're feeling up to the task, now?
        Naomi: I'm not {i}happy{/i} to be doing yard work...
        Naomi: But, time is passing excruciatingly slowly.
        Naomi: So, I'd rather be doing {i}something{/i} to keep myself occupied.
        Me: Well, I won't stop you.
        Narator: You hand the rake to Naomi.
        Narator: Soon after, she begins raking.
        Narator: You, on the other hand, put on some gardening gloves.
        Narator: Focused on the task at hand, you begin pulling out the weeds and dry brush.
        Naomi: So... [m!ct]...
        Naomi: When did you become such a gentleman?
        Me: (Woah, where did that comment come from?)
        Me: *Chuckle* You say that like I wasn't one, before.
        Naomi: *Laugh* Well... You've made great progress recently.
        Me: Thank you, my lady.
        Naomi: Oh, {i}your{/i} lady?
        Me: (Oops. I shouldn't have said that.)
        Me: I was just--
        Naomi: *Chuckle* [m!ct], I'm just fucking with you.
        Me: Pfft. I knew that.
        Narator: You both begin clearing the area a bit more methodically.
        Narator: At the same time, you strike up a conversation to make the work more...
        Narator: Fun.
        Me: Hey, Naomi.
        Naomi: Yes?
        Me: Can I ask you something?
            Naomi: Sure. What do you want to ask?
                    Naomi: You make me sound like a different species... What do you actually mean?
                            Naomi: \"Among the elites.\" *Chuckle* If you MUST know... it's fairly mundane.
                                    Naomi: Well, the people just suck. They're all so fake...
                                            Naomi: Do you really mean that?
                                        Me: Then you have something in common with them...
                                    Naomi: My dad does... when I actually see him.
                                            Naomi: Well, you can blame my bitch of a mother for that...
                                        Me: That's a shame, mostly because of the mom situation.
                                            Naomi: Wait, wait... You listened to me?
                        Me: What's it like growing up in the upper echelons?
                            Naomi: *Chuckle* It was mostly a bore...
                                    Naomi: It's intoxicating, at first... But, yes. It is.
                                            Naomi: My dad is... when he's around.
                                                Me: Well, I hope he spends more time with you in the future.
                                    Naomi: Unfortunately not... anymore.
                                        Me: Sorry to hear that... Hopefully I don't bore you.
                    Naomi: Wow, so direct. What exactly do you want to know?
                            Naomi: She and I don't have the best relationship...
                                    Naomi: I did. She left me here, so she could keep being a wino bitch...
                                        Me: So, what really made your mom send you here?
                                Narator: Sensing Naomi’s unease, you drop the subject.
                        Me: What's your relationship with your dad like?
                            Naomi: Oh, daddy? We have a good relationship, but...
                                    Naomi: It's not his fault...
                                            Naomi: You... listened to me?
                                    Naomi: If it weren't for my mother... He wouldn't have to work so hard.
                                            Naomi: If only it were that simple...
                                                Me: Look, if you ever need to talk... I'm here for you, Naomi.
        Narator: You decide to wait, having done enough chores at camp already.
        Narator: Naomi looks at you, waiting for you to start.
        Me: (I really think my strategy will work...)
        Me: *Whistling a melody*
        Naomi: (Why isn't he doing anything?)
        Naomi: Hey...
        Naomi: Are you going to do... anything?
        Me: Oh, I was just waiting for you to start.
        Naomi: Waiting for {i}me?{/i}
        Me: I just wanted to follow {i}your{/i} lead.
        Naomi: Wow...
        Narator: Naomi, frustrated by your decision, picks up the rake and begins raking.
        Narator: Taking your cue, you put on the gardening gloves.
        Narator: Focused on the task at hand, you begin pulling out the weeds and dry brush.
        Narator: At first, Naomi looks annoyed by how you acted...
        Narator: However, after a bit more time watching you work hard, she speaks.
        Naomi: Hey, [m!t]...
        Me: Yeah?
        Naomi: I'm still not over your approach to getting me working...
        Naomi: But, I appreciate that you helped me out immediately.
        Naomi: Well, after your initial stunt, actually.
        Me: No problem, Naomi.
        Me: I'm actually happy to help you.
        Me: I think we'll get this done pretty quickly, as a team.
        Naomi: So... [m!ct]...
        Naomi: When did you become such a gentleman?
        Me: (Woah, where did that comment come from?)
        Me: *Chuckle* You say that like I wasn't one, before.
        Naomi: *Laugh* Well... You've made great progress recently.
        Me: Thank you, my lady.
        Naomi: Oh, {i}your{/i} lady?
        Me: (Shit... I shouldn't have said that.)
        Me: I was just...
        Naomi: *Chuckle* [m!ct], I'm just fucking with you.
        Me: Yeah, heh. I knew you were.
Narator: You both continue working happily and efficiently.
Narator: Soon, you're nearly done with Naomi's task.
Me: Hey, Naomi?
Naomi: Yes?
Me: Are you...
Me: ...having a good time with me, today?
Narator: Naomi stops raking, and looks directly into your eyes.
Naomi: I'm actually having a really nice time here, with you.
Naomi: Despite the reason we're out here.
Naomi: Thanks for talking to me...
Naomi: (And, for opening up to me.)
Me: Maybe we'll get more opportunities to hang out, one-on-one.
Naomi: If we do, I just hope it won't involve more yard work.
Naomi: You really want to know?
Naomi: Ugh. Okay...
Naomi: Prepare yourself.
Me: I'm listening.
Naomi: So... This is what happened...
Naomi: My mother was never a {i}kind{/i} woman...
Naomi: She was a spoiled princess, born into wealth...
Naomi: And, I know what you might be thinking...
Naomi: Everyone's said the same thing about me, my whole life.
Me: Naomi, I wasn't going to--
Naomi: It doesn't matter.
Naomi: So. She was a princess born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
Naomi: Her parents, my grandparents, never paid any attention to her...
Naomi: Instead, they showered her with gifts.
Naomi: Dresses, makeup, earrings... Whatever she wanted.
Me: And, that spoiled her?
Naomi: Exactly.
Naomi: She was accustomed to living the high-life...
Naomi: But, she was cut off by her parents when she turned 30.
Naomi: She never really tried to make anything of herself.
Naomi: She just spent, spent, spent.
Naomi: But, instead of getting some kind of job to support her lifestyle...
Naomi: She chose the easy route.
Me: She married rich.
Naomi: Yep.
Naomi: She found a new sponsor.
Naomi: At first, she kept her spending somewhat reasonable.
Naomi: But, once she saw my dad's career developments...
Naomi: She saw that as her green light to go wild.
Naomi: As he made more money, she spent more.
Naomi: She also has other vices, though...
Naomi: Particularly wine and young men.
Naomi: I overheard her on the phone one day...
Naomi: Drunk, a glass of champagne in hand...
Naomi: She was arranging a meetup with one of her \"toys\"...
Me: (So, her mom is a MILF?)
Me: ([m!ct], stay focused...)
Naomi: I was furious!
Naomi: She was spending my dad's money, which made him busier and busier...
Naomi: And she had the fucking {i}balls{/i} to go behind his back like that?!
Naomi: So, of course I told him.
Naomi: She went psycho.
Naomi: That lying bitch made up some BS about me...
Naomi: But, I still managed to make my dad suspicious of my mom.
Naomi: He hired a private investigator, who collected all the dirt my dad needed.
Naomi: They're getting divorced.
Me: Wait...
Me: Is that why you're here?
Me: Because of the lie your mom told about you?
Naomi: Yeah.
Naomi: But, I'd rather not get into that right now.
Me: Wait, so your dad bought what she said?
Naomi: [m!ct], please. Not now...
Me: (Why would her dad believe his cheating wife, and send Naomi here?)
Me: Okay... I won't push it.
Naomi: {i}Thank you.{/i}
Me: Thank {i}you{/i}, Naomi... for opening up to me.
Naomi: WOW!
Naomi: Who knew you could be such an asshole!?
Narator: Naomi angrily throws the rake to the ground.
Me: (Why did I need to poke the bear?)
Me: Look... Naomi.
Naomi: Fuck off!
Me: (I should just leave her alone...)
Me: (I'm only making her angrier being here.)
Narator: You keep doing Naomi's chores for a while...
Narator: ...before you speak up again.
Me: Naomi...
Me: I was being an idiot.
Naomi: Yes, you were.
Me: And... I really am sorry.
Me: I've been rude to you for no real reason...
Naomi: Yes, {i}you have.{/i}
Naomi: You'll have to do much more to make it up to me...
Naomi: But, for now, we can remain civil.
Me: Oh thank god...
Naomi: Don't thank god, thank {i}me!{/i}
Me: (Her ego is GARGANTUAN...)
Me: Okay.
Me: Thank {i}you,{/i} Naomi.
Narator: Naomi smiles at you with warm kindness...
Narator: ...and growing affection.
Naomi: You're a nice guy, [m!t].
Me: (Huh?)
Me: Uh, thanks, Naomi.
Me: I think you're a nice girl, too.
Naomi: Do you, now?
Naomi: When I first got to camp, you had this look on your face...
Naomi: You were judging me.
Naomi: So, I fulfilled your warped expectations of me.
Me: I didn't know you then.
Me: Now that I do, I'd never think the same.
Naomi: Do you really mean it?
Me: I do.
Me: I think I actually understand you...
Naomi: Oh, do you?
Me: At least better than before.
Me: (I'm sure there are even more quirks to your personality...)
Naomi: There's no denying that.
Naomi: *Giggle* You're actually not as dumb as I thought you were.
Me: Heh. Thanks, I guess.
Naomi: That's a compliment!
Naomi: You also have a nice bod.
Me: Uh, thanks, Naomi.
Me: (So do you.)
Narator: As you and Naomi finish clearing the campsite...
Narator: Eve arrives, ready to hear how it all went.
Eve: Wow!
Eve: The area looks great, guys!
Eve: You both did a wonderful job.
Naomi: Why, thank you!
Eve: So, how did that feel, Naomi?
Eve: That wasn't too difficult, now, was it?
Naomi: Actually... It wasn't that terrible.
Naomi: *Softly* [m!t] actually helped out a lot.
Eve: Hmm... How kind of him.
Me: It was nothing.
Eve: Naomi. You and I will have a short debrief later in the day.
Eve: At the moment, I'm a bit behind schedule.
Eve: So, [m!t], why don't you show Naomi back to the campground?
Me: It would be my pleasure.
Eve: Wonderful. See you both later.
Me: Shall we?
Naomi: After you.
Me: Well, here we are.
Naomi: You were quite a fine \"chauffer\".
Naomi: You're dismissed for the time being.
Me: If you insist.
Me: Till we meet again.
Naomi: Toodles, [m!t]!
Narator: Having been dismissed by Naomi, you decide to head back to the house.
Me: Ahh... (I finally have a little time to relax...)
Narator: You make your way back through the campground, and to the house.
Narator: Outside, you hear voices trailing off toward the Community Area's deck.
Me: Hmm... (I wonder who that could be?)
Narator: Curious who it is, you walk around the house to hear the voices better.
Narator: Getting closer to the source, you realize the voices belong to Eve...
Eve: Please be more cooperative...
Narator: ...and Belle.
Belle: Uggghh! I'm trying!
Belle: I just can't help it.
Belle: My mind loves going there...
Me: (She has to be talking about sex.)
Eve: Well, since your mind is allegedly uncontrollable...
Eve: ...I believe our best course of action is to do some meditation.
Belle: Oooh... Anything kinky?
Eve: Of course not!
Eve: But, I think it will help you take your therapy more seriously.
Eve: Hmmm... I think the dock would be the perfect place to meditate.
Eve: Nobody should be there to interrupt us.
Narator: Thinking quick, you walk back toward the front door.
Me: (So, Eve and Belle are gonna meditate?)
Me: (Really? Just meditation?)
Me: (I'm curious to see how that will go...)
Me: (Especially with Belle's tendency to get... distracted.)
Me: (I mean, I {i}could{/i} also just chill on the couch for a bit.)
Me: (Both options sound pretty good.)
Narator: You stand there a moment longer, wondering what you should do.
Me: (Hmm...)
        Me: (Hmm...)
Me: (I think going to the dock is the better choice...)
Me: (It'll {i}definitely{/i} be more entertaining than TV.)
Narator: You walk away from the house, and down the path.
Me: (Every day I learn new things about these girls...)
Me: (I'm actually starting to get used to their quirks.)
Me: Heh. (I'd say they're starting to get used to mine, too.)
Me: (This is gonna be interesting...)
Me: (I wonder how quickly Belle will drive poor Eve crazy...)
Me: (Hopefully she cooperates. Despite how boring that might be.)
Me: (If there were more to do at camp...)
Me: (I wouldn't have to entertain myself by eavesdropping...)
Me: (Ah, whatever.)
Narator: Soon, you make it to the area near the dock.
Me: (Okay, now that I'm here...)
Me: (Where can I hide?)
Me: (Hmm... It looks like I have three options.)
Me: (I can hide behind the changing booth.)
Me: (I can... hide behind this rock? Maybe?)
Me: (Or, I can just sit on the edge of the dock, and act casual.)
Me: (What should I do...)
Me: (The rock?)
Me: (Uhh... Sure, sure.)
Me: (I guess this is a decent enough spot.)
Narator: You crouch down, attempting to hide behind the average-sized rock.
Narator: While crouched, and \"hidden,\" you spot someone near the edge of the lake...
Me: (Who's that, over there?)
Narator: It's Emily.
Me: (What's Emily doing over there?)
Me: (It looks like she's... skipping stones?)
Me: (If she spots me behind this rock, I'm screwed.)
Narator: As you think that dreadful thought...
Narator: ...Emily skips one more stone...
Narator: ...before she notices you crouched behind the rock.
Emily: Oh, hi [m!t]!
Me: (Damn, she noticed me!)
Narator: Realizing your cover is blown, you stand up, greeting Emily.
Me: Hey, Em!
Narator: She walks over to you, smiling as she does.
Me: How's it going?
Emily: Good, just skipping stones!
Emily: What were you doing hiding behind this rock?
Emily: Spying on meeee?
Me: *Chuckle* No, no...
Me: (Quick, come up with something!)
Me: I was just... looking for salamanders.
Emily: (What? Salamanders?)
Emily: I didn't take you for a herpetologist.
Me: A herpe-what now?
Emily: A herpetologist.
Emily: Someone who studies reptiles and amphibians.
Me: Where'd you learn that?
Emily: That TV channel. World Wild Web.
Me: Aha, makes sense.
Me: To answer your question, no. I'm not.
Me: I just thought I saw one scurry under this rock.
Me: And, uhh... decided to investigate.
Emily: Oh? So, you're a reptile detective now?
Me: I... I guess so, Em.
Emily: *Giggle*
Emily: Smart choice, [m!t].
Emily: Starting with the easier cases, and working your way up.
Me: Yep, you gotta start somewhere.
Me: Anyway...
Me: Sorry for interrupting your stone skipping.
Emily: It's okay. Do you wanna join me?
Me: (My cover is already blown... So, why not?)
Me: Sure, that would be cool.
Narator: You give up on your feeble attempt at blending in with the environment.
Narator: Instead, smartly deciding to join Emily at the lake's edge.
Narator: You pick up a small, flat stone from the lake's shore.
Me: (Flat, angled parallel to the water, and--)
Narator: You flick your wrist, sending the rock flying.
Narator: You both watch it skip three times, then fumble and sink into the water.
Me: (A decent attempt...)
Emily: Good job, [m!t]!
Emily: But, {i}watch this.{/i}
Narator: Emily bends down...
Narator: ...and grabs a smooth, flat stone.
Narator: She brings it to her lips, and gives it a tiny kiss.
Emily: For good luck, ya know?
Me: Whatever helps.
Me: (Does she kiss every single stone she throws?)
Narator: Emily then bends down a bit...
Narator: ...closes one eye...
Narator: ...and winds her arm up.
Emily: Aaaaaandd!
Narator: The rock flies from the palm of her hand, along her fingertips...
Narator: ...and away, skipping across the lake's surface.
Narator: The stone skips 7 times before faltering, sinking into the water.
Emily: Yes! A personal best!
Me: (Woah, she's way better at that than I am.)
Me: Great job! Looks like you've been practicing.
Emily: You noticed?
Me: I mean, yeah. How could I not?
Me: You beat me by more than double my amount of skips.
Emily: Maybe I can let you in on my {i}secret techniques...{/i}
Me: I'd really appreciate that, Em.
Narator: As Emily begins training you in the ancient art of stone skipping...
Narator: You see Eve and Belle begin their session on the dock.
Me: (Damn it, I missed my chance to listen in on their meditation session...)
Me: (When did they even get there?)
Emily: Hellooooo, [m!t].
Emily: Was my lecture that boring?
Me: Huh? Oh, no. Sorry.
Me: I zoned out for a second.
Emily: No prob. Let's continue.
Narator: As Emily teaches you her tricks, you occasionally glance over at Eve and Belle.
Me: (I wonder what they're saying...)
Me: (Ugh. The rock was the worst hiding place I could have chosen.)
Narator: Finishing her lecture, Emily gives you the go-ahead to try her techniques.
Emily: It's time, grasshopper.
Emily: Let the stone fly.
Narator: You get into position, as Emily did before.
Narator: Upon entering perfect form, you whip your arm back...
Narator: And, the moment it flings forward, the stone flies out of your hand.
Emily: Wooooah!
Narator: As you watch the stone skip across the lake...
Narator: ...you glance back at the dock and see Eve and Belle standing up.
Narator: On the seventh skip the rock sinks into the water.
Emily: 7 skips, [m!t]! You tied my record!
Narator: You see Eve and Belle leaving the dock, going back to the campgrounds.
Me: (Ugh... They're going back to camp, now.)
Emily: You have learned well, grasshopper.
Me: Thanks, sensei.
Narator: In passing, Eve turns toward the two of you and waves.
Eve: Hey you two, it's lunch time!
Narator: As you begin to walk back toward the camp, Emily grabs your arm.
Emily: Wait a sec, [m!t]...
Emily: There's something I need to admit...
Me: What is it?
Emily: I've been manipulating you... a teensy bit.
Me: (What the hell does she mean?)
Emily: I... {i}maaaay{/i} have been misleading your investigation...
Emily: ...on purpose.
Me: What?
Emily: I wanted you to be suspicious of me.
Me: What were you thinking?!
Emily: I wasn't! That's the problem!
Emily: I wanted to spend time with you so badly...
Emily: But, you were either busy with Eve's chores...
Emily: ...or, spending your free time with the new girls.
Emily: Completely forgetting about me.
Me: (Is she serious?)
Emily: I felt... invisible to you.
Emily: [m!ct]... I'm so sorry.
Emily: I didn't mean to torture you...
Me: I'm shocked... but...
Me: (She seems genuinely apologetic...)
Me: I forgive you.
Emily: Oh, really, [m!t]?
Emily: Thank you, thank you so much.
Narator: Emily jumps on you, hugging you tightly.
Me: Em...
Emily: What is it?
Me: You're crushing me.
Emily: Oh, sorry!
Me: Let's go, Em. Lunch is waiting.
Me: (The changing booth is my best bet.)
Me: (But, I might not hear them that well from over there.)
Me: (Better than being caught, though.)
Narator: Confident in your choice to hide out behind the changing booth...
Narator: You get into position, and eagerly await Eve and Belle.
Me: (This is a great hiding spot. They'll never see me over here.)
Narator: You wait behind the changing booth wall.
Narator: Occasionally peeking around the corner, to check for Eve and Belle.
Me: (They're really taking their sweet time...)
Narator: Eventually, you peek your head around as usual and spot them on the dock.
Me: (Finally!)
Me: (Now the show can begin.)
Narator: Eve beckons toward the ground, inviting Belle to sit.
Eve: Please, sit. Get comfortable.
Narator: Belle sits down, legs crossed.
Narator: Shortly after, Eve does the same.
Belle: Like this? Ooooooommmmmm.
Eve: If you're comfortable like that, sure.
Eve: But, we won't be chanting any mantras today.
Belle: Thaaaaat is laaaaameee.
Eve: Please, just quiet your mind.
Eve: Close your eyes...
Eve: And, listen to my voice.
Me: (Huh.)
Me: (I can actually hear them pretty well.)
Me: (Hopefully they keep talking at this volume.)
Eve: Listen to the words...
Eve: Let them resonate within your mind...
Eve: Like the sound of a perfectly tuned bell.
Belle: I don't hear the bell.
Eve: It was a simile, Belle.
Eve: Please, focus.
Me: (That's going to be the hardest part...)
Me: (Getting her to settle down.)
Narator: Belle assumes a good meditative posture and quiets down.

Eve: Take a slow... deep... breath.
Eve: Inhale fully, and exhale.
Belle: *Deep breath in*
Belle: *Long exhale*
Eve: Good.
Eve: Notice your breath...
Eve: Bring all your awareness there.
Eve: Slowly allow your awareness to shift...
Eve: Notice the thoughts going through your mind.
Narator: Eve goes quiet, and pauses for a few moments, allowing Belle to think.
Eve: What did you think about?
Belle: Well...
Belle: At first, I thought about the feeling of a man inside me.
Me: (I'm not surprised one bit...)
Eve: Belle, please! Keep it PG.
Belle: I thought meditation was for the open-minded.
Eve: You're--You're right. Please, continue...
Belle: Then, I thought about you, in sexy lingerie...
Eve: *Clears throat*
Belle: After that, I thought about...
Belle: Someone I met recently.
Eve: Oh. Is it one of the other patients?
Belle: Well, it might be...
Me: (I hope she doesn't mention me...)
Belle: But, that doesn't matter right now.
Belle: There was something beyond all of that, though...
Eve: Please, elaborate...
Belle: Well... For some reason, I imagined myself in a room...
Belle: From my childhood.
Me: (I wonder what her childhood was like...)
Me: (I'd guess she has daddy issues.)
Eve: Can you describe the room for me?
Belle: It was a small, square room.
Belle: Pink walls, with white trim. Like a dollhouse...
Belle: I saw my old dolls, my bed, my vanity table, and...
Belle: My father came into the room, and the room faded away.
Eve: (I wonder what association she has with her father...)
Eve: Thank you, Belle.
Eve: Let's continue.
Eve: Do not get caught up in your thoughts.
Eve: Notice them as they travel across your mind.
Eve: Do not focus on them, do not stop them...
Eve: Let them go. Let them pass.
Eve: Like water flowing beneath a bridge.
Eve: Continue breathing deeply.
Eve: I will describe places. Feel them, make them real in your mind.
Eve: You see an ocean.
Eve: It is deep, and blue...
Eve: Beneath your feet is a sandy beach.
Eve: You feel the sand's warmth under your toes.
Eve: The ocean's waves change, and become the peaks of sand dunes.
Eve: The sand extends from where you stand to the horizon.
Eve: It is endless, but you don't feel hot.
Eve: It is the perfect temperature, neither hot nor cold.
Eve: You feel a breeze, and the sand caresses your cheek.
Eve: You look up, and see the vast, endless blue of the sky.
Eve: A black dot crosses your vision.
Eve: It is the silhouette of a bird.
Eve: You focus your eyes on the bird, realizing it's an eagle.
Eve: Your eyes follow the eagle, until it lands on the top of a tall pine tree.
Eve: You follow the pine tree, down to the earth...
Eve: ...realizing you're in a forest.
Eve: Recognizing the trees, you see a lake in the distance.
Eve: Slowly, you approach the lake...
Eve: As you come closer, two people come into view.
Eve: They are sitting on a dock, meditating.
Eve: Go toward the {i}you{/i} sitting on the dock.
Eve: Rejoin with yourself, and take a final, deep breath.
Belle: *Deep inhale*
Eve: Good. Now, exhale.
Belle: *Long exhale*
Eve: And, open your eyes.
Eve: Welcome back.
Eve: How do you feel?
Belle: I feel...
Belle: Pretty relaxed.
Eve: That's good. Any other feelings?
Belle: I feel... oddly content. Lighter.
Eve: Good, then our sessions going forward will be more impactful.
Belle: You think?
Eve: I have a good feeling about it.
Me: (She didn't divulge anything interesting...)
Me: (But, I oddly feel like I've been on that mental journey, with Belle.)
Me: (Eve is pretty good at guiding meditations.)
Me: (She could have easily started her own studio, in another life.) 
Narator: Eve stands up, offering Belle her hand.
Eve: Here, take my hand.
Belle: Gladly.
Narator: Eve helps Belle up from her seated position.
Belle: (Eve's hands are so soft...)
Belle: Thanks.
Eve: Now, let's get you back to your campground.
Eve: It's almost lunch time.
Me: (Oh, is it?)
Me: (I should wait here a bit before heading over there.)
Me: (Just to make sure they don't suspect me of spying.)
Me: (I think playing it cool would work out best.)
Me: (If anything, they'll just ask me to leave.)
Me: (No biggie.)
Narator: Casually, you walk over to the dock.
Narator: You sit down, letting your legs hang over the edge.
Narator: Taking in the scenery, you spot Emily at the lake's edge, skipping stones.
Narator: She notices you too, and waves at you.
Narator: You wave back at Emily.
Narator: She smiles at you as she skips another stone.
Me: (It's a pretty nice day.)
Me: (Kinda getting hot, though.)
Narator: Emily skips a few more stones, while you relax on the dock...
Narator: Before Eve and Belle arrive.
Eve: Oh, hi [m!t].
Me: Hey Eve.
Belle: Heeeey, [m!t]. What're you up to?
Me: Just enjoying the lake.
Eve: Sorry for doing this... but, you'll need to find another spot.
Eve: We need some privacy for Belle's session.
Me: Ah, yeah... no prob--
Belle: Please, Eve. Let [m!t] join us.
Me: (She's really roping {i}me{/i} into this!?)
Eve: I don't think that's a good idea.
Belle: I think he'd be {i}great{/i} support.
Belle: I'd feel more relaxed with [m!t] joining in the meditation.
Eve: Belle, no.
Eve: That would definitely distract you.
Belle: How is this fair?
Belle: Naomi had [m!t]'s support during her session...
Belle: That just doesn't seem fair to me.
Eve: Well...
Eve: *Sigh* Okay.
Eve: If you promise to take this seriously, Belle.
Eve: And, if [m!t] promises to be quiet and courteous.
Me: Deal.
Belle: Thanks, Eve!
Eve: Belle, [m!t].
Eve: Please, sit down and get into a comfortable position.
Narator: You and Belle sit down, cross-legged.
Eve: Good. Now, close your eyes.
Narator: You both follow Eve's suggestion and close your eyes.
Eve: Good. Gooood.
Eve: Place one hand on your stomach, and one hand on your chest.
Narator: You and Belle both put your hands where instructed.
Eve: Feel your chest rise and fall.
Eve: Feel your stomach rise and fall.
Eve: Inhale.
Eve: Exhale.
Narator: Seeing you and Belle following along smoothly, and without resistance...
Narator: Eve closes her eyes, before continuing to lead the meditation.
Eve: Continue breathing naturally, feeling the air flow into your nostrils...
Eve: Then, out through your nostrils.
Eve: Continue to feel your breath for a few moments.
Narator: With eyes closed, you hear all three of you breathing calmly.
Eve: *Exhales* On the next inhale, feel your belly rise.
Narator: Oddly, you feel a sensation near your knee.
Me: (Hmm?)
Eve: Then, feel your ribs expand, and your chest lift up.
Narator: As Eve says this, you feel the sensation move upwards.
Me: (What's on my leg?)
Me: (A bug?)
Eve: On the exhale, the breath leaves your chest.
Eve: Your ribs fall, and stomach contracts.
Narator: You take a peek down at your leg, and see nothing there.
Narator: You then peek up toward Belle, and see her in meditation, eyes closed.
Me: (Huh, nothing.)
Me: (Must have been a bug...)
Eve: Continue with this breath, feeling all three parts of the breath.
Eve: Think to yourself...
Eve: Stomach...
Narator: You once again feel the sensation on your knee.
Eve: Ribs...
Narator: You feel the sensation move up your leg, again.
Me: (What the hell is that?!)
Eve: Chest...
Narator: The sensation quickly rushes up your leg and to your crotch.
Me: *Muffled cough* (BELLE?! WHAT THE HELL?!)
Narator: You quickly, but cautiously peek over at Belle...
Narator: A huge, playful, grin is plastered across her face.
Narator: She winks at you, before making a \"shh\" sign with her hand...
Narator: Before continuing to rub your crotch some more.
Me: *Muffled choking* (What's she doing?!)
Me: (She'll get us both caught!)
Narator: Despite your slight commotion, Eve continues the meditation.
Eve: Breathe... Breathe... 
Eve: Repeat this breath three times.
Narator: Belle continues stroking your crotch as the meditation continues...
Narator: Making you rock hard.
Me: (Ah fuck, she gave me a hard-on...)
Me: (I hope, for our sake, that Eve doesn't notice it...)
Eve: With your third exhale, begin to feel the breath...
Narator: Belle keeps grabbing at your girthy member, with growing intensity.
Eve: Feel the breath as a wave coming up from the stomach, and rising...
Me: (Shit, she's gonna make me...)
Eve: Hold this breath for two counts.
Narator: You grab Belle's hand, stopping its assault on your crotch.
Belle: (Aww, the fun's over?)
Eve: Now, exhale. 
Narator: As you exhale, you twinge with a slight pain from blue balls.
Eve: Feel calmness in the breath.
Narator: You hold Belle's hand for a moment, before pushing it away.
Me: (Wow, her hands are so soft.)
Belle: (Oh, his grip is {i}strong...{/i})
Eve: Feel ease and steadiness.
Eve: When you're both ready, open your eyes.
Narator: You and Belle open your eyes calmly.
Eve: Belle, how do you feel?
Belle: I feel super relaxed.
Eve: Good. I think our next session will be fruitful.
Narator: Eve stands up first, then you stand.
Me: Need a hand?
Belle: (Giving me a hand after I gave you one?)
Narator: You offer your hand to Belle, helping her up.
Belle: You're such a gentleman, [m!t].
Eve: Well, that's it for your session for today, Belle.
Eve: Now, it's lunch time.
Narator: As you stand before Eve, she unfortunately notices your bulge.
Eve: (Is that a...)
Eve: (Why the hell does he have a hard-on!?)
Eve: (Ah... The hormones of young men.)
Narator: However, she makes no comment about it...
Narator: In fact, she brushes it off as if she hadn't seen it at all.
Eve: Follow me, you two.
Me: (Relaxing back at the house, on the couch, sounds {i}pretty{/i} nice...)
Me: (I've barely had any time to chill on the couch since I got here.)
Narator: You follow your desire to relax and head inside the house.
Narator: Once inside, you plop down onto the couch.
Me: Aaaahhh...
Narator: You reach for the remote and turn on the TV.
Me: (I wonder if there's anything good on.)
Narator: You flip through the channels...
Me: (Soap operas, news, reality shows...)
Me: (Doesn't seem like anything good is on.)
Narator: Eventually, you give up and settle on a random channel.
Me: (Guess I'll just watch... {i}this.{/i})
Me: (Whatever {i}this{/i} is...)
Narator: You spend a few moments watching the channel you ended up on.
Me: (What even is this?)
Me: (Who makes these shows, anyway?)
Me: *Yawn* (This is why TV is dead...)
Narator: Luckily for you, the front door opens and Kiara walks in with the groceries.
Kiara: Oh, hey [m!t]. How's it going?
Me: Hey, Kiara. Need any help?
Kiara: Oh, no no. It's fine. 
Kiara: I'll just put these in the kitchen, and be right back.
Narator: As Kiara pops into the kitchen momentarily...
Narator: ...you realize your opportunity has arrived.
Me: (This is my chance to talk to Kiara.)
Me: (I need to settle this stupid mystery, {i}now.{/i})
Narator: Kiara returns from the kitchen, breaking your thought process.
Narator: She quickly sits down next to you on the couch.
Kiara: What ya watchin'?
Me: Oh, nothing really.
Me: There's nothing good on right now.
Narator: You turn the TV off, giving you and Kiara the chance to talk.
Me: Hey, Kiara...
Kiara: Hey, [m!t].
Me: Can I ask you something?
    Kiara: Sure. What's up?
        Me: I want to cut the BS... Why did you have that rope and mask?
            Kiara: I told you, they magically appeared.
                Me: Do you think I really buy that? Tell me the truth!
                Me: We both know things don't just \"magically\" appear...
                    Kiara: Well, yeah. It's just a figure of speech. Someone must have planted them there.
                        Me: Why even hide them, and not just throw them away?
                            Kiara: I don't know... Look, I really don't know anything else...
                                Me: Fine, I believe you... (I'll have to try again later.)
                            Kiara: I don't know. Maybe it was one of the patients...
                                Me: You're right, they are sneaky... (I'll try again later.)
        Me: Remember what we talked about the other night?
            Kiara: I think so... Wasn't it about the morning you woke up in the forest?
                    Kiara: I remember now. Did you ever find out who did it?
                Me: Yeah. Specifically, it was about that rope and mask.
                    Kiara: Oh yeah. I told you that night, though. I don't know how that stuff got under my bed.
                        Me: That's the big mystery now... Anyway, thanks for the help.
Kiara: Look, [m!t]... I really have to get going.
Kiara: I'm supposed to prepare lunch for today, and I'm already running late.
Me: (She definitely seems anxious.)
Me: (My questioning probably spooked her.)
Me: No worries. Go ahead.
Me: Oh, do you need any help making lunch?
Kiara: No, no. It's fine.
Kiara: I'll be quicker working on my own.
Me: If you say so...
Me: (She's really freaked out... I think this confirms it...)
Me: (It must have been her.)
Narator: In a flash, Kiara is done making lunch.
Narator: You see her emerge from the kitchen holding a tray of sandwiches.
Me: (Guess our lunch today is sandwiches.)
Narator: Immediately after...
Narator: She takes the sandwiches piled on the tray out the front door.
Kiara: Really gotta go, see ya!
Me: See you later, Kiara.
Narator: Kiara leaves the house, rushing toward the girls' campground.
Me: (She was acting really suspicious...)
Me: (Oh well, I'll get my answers later.)
Narator: You get up off the couch and head to the girls' campground for lunch.
Kiara: Sorry to leave you so soon, but I really have to go prep lunch.
Me: Lunch?
Kiara: Today, we're all having some simple sandwiches.
Kiara: Nothing extravagant.
Me: Need any help?
Kiara: No, no. It's okay.
Kiara: It won't take me that long.
Me: Well, if you say so...
Narator: In a flash, Kiara is done making the sandwiches.
Narator: Immediately after...
Narator: She takes the sandwiches piled on the tray out the front door.
Kiara: See you at lunch, [m!t]!
Me: Oh, not waiting for me?
Kiara: Can't! Sorry!
Kiara: I'm already running late. Lunch should have started 15 minutes ago...
Me: See you later!
Narator: Kiara leaves the house, rushing toward the girls' campground.
Me: (She was acting pretty suspicious...)
Me: (She seemed a bit anxious...)
Me: (Although, I'm sure being late for lunch was also making it worse.)
Narator: You get up off the couch and head to the girls' campground for lunch.
Narator: Back at the girls' campground, everyone is gathering for lunch.
Narator: You see Kiara passing out sandwiches to the girls, from the tray.
Kiara: Here you go.
Stacy: Thank you.
Violet: Do you have anything with less mayo?
Kiara: I actually made one especially for you.
Violet: Oh, really?
Eve: We take our patients' specific diets very seriously.
Violet: Well, thank you Dr. Eve.
Eve: It's my pleasure.
Narator: Kiara distributes the rest of the sandwiches to the girls...
Narator: Leaving four sandwiches for the Red Falls staff.
Narator: Kiara approaches you cautiously, but collectedly.
Kiara: Here you go, [m!t].
Kiara: Bon appétit.
Me: Thanks, Kiara.
Narator: Feeling the tension from Kiara, you decide to go eat with the girls.
Me: Hey girls, enjoying lunch?
Stacy: Hello, [m!t].
Naomi: They call this food?
Me: Naomi, this is just a little snack.
Violet: I think it's a pretty decent sandwich.
Me: Kiara does make a mean submarine sandwich.
Belle: Too bad we couldn't try one of those today.
Me: Who knows...
Me: Maybe you'll get the chance one of these days.
Narator: You and the girls finish up your sandwiches.
Narator: As you do, Belle gets the group's attention.
Belle: Girls, girls!
Belle: I have a surpriiiise.
Naomi: Do you, now?
Stacy: How intriguing.
Belle: Everyone, close your eyes...
    Belle: Okay! You can all open your eyes now.
    Narator: You and the girls all open your eyes.
    Narator: Before you sits Belle, holding a small key in her fingers.
    Naomi: A key?
    Naomi: You think {i}that's{/i} exciting?
    Belle: This isn't {i}any{/i} key...
    Me: (Wait a second... is that--)
    Belle: This is a key I found in [m!t]'s room.
    Violet: You were in [m!t]'s room?
    Me: You went into my room?!
    Belle: It was a happy accident.
    Belle: I thought it was the bathroom...
    Me: {i}How convenient.{/i}
    Me: Thanks for respecting my privacy.
    Me: (So damn shameless...)
    Belle: So! What's the key for?
    Stacy: Yes. Please, {i}enlighten us.{/i}
    Me: I... I don't know, actually.
    Me: I found it in the bushes outside the house.
    Me: (I hope they buy my bluff.)
    Violet: So, it must be a key for the house.
    Belle: Ooooh, now I'm super curious what it goes to.
    Belle: Are you {i}suuuuure{/i} you don't know?
    Me: Yeah, I really don't know...
    Naomi: Ooooh, [m!t] is hiding something...
    Belle: Okay! You can all open your eyes now.
    Narator: You and the girls all open your eyes.
    Narator: Before you sits Belle, holding a pair of your boxers.
    Naomi: Men's underwear?
    Naomi: This {i}is{/i} exciting, Belle.
    Belle: You know what's going to excite you even more?
    Belle: These aren't just {i}any{/i} underwear...
    Me: (What the hell, are those--)
    Belle: These are [m!t]'s underwear!
    Narator: Violet's eyes go wide as she blushes.
    Violet: Y-You were in [m!t]'s room?
    Me: You went into my room?!
    Belle: It was a happy accident.
    Belle: I thought it was the bathroom...
    Me: Convenient excuse.
    Me: Thanks for respecting my privacy.
    Me: (So damn shameless...)
    Belle: So! Who wants to touch them?
    Narator: Belle passes your underwear around to the other girls.
    Narator: You look on in frustration, feeling a sense of violation.
    Me: (She went into my room...)
    Me: (Found my underwear...)
    Me: (And is passing them around like a {i}trophy.{/i})
    Narator: You become more and more wound-up by the situation...
    Narator: ...which visibly pleases Naomi.
Naomi: This is so exciting!
Narator: Naomi, giddy from your clear discomfort claps her hands.
Violet: *Gasp*
Narator: Violet, triggered by Naomi's giddy clapping, begins twitching.
Belle: What's wrong, Violet?
Violet: *Muffled groan* I... I think I got bit by a fire ant.
Violet: Sorry, I have to go!
Narator: As Violet rushes back to the campground, the girls look on...
Narator: Suspiciously.
Stacy: It looked like Violet just--
Me: Huh? Nah, I think she just got bitten by an ant.
Naomi: I usually don't make noises like that when I get bitten by ants...
Belle: Yeah, I make those noises when I'm horny.
Stacy: Or, reveling near a big fire.
Naomi: No. Only {i}your people{/i} do that, Stacy...
Me: You must have misheard, Belle.
Belle: This was a {i}really, really{/i} familiar sound...
    Belle: Hmm... What do you think, stud?
            Belle: Startled? I don't usually moan when I'm startled...
                Me: I don't think she moaned, though. It was more of a whimper.
                Me: Maybe she does? Everybody reacts differently...
                    Belle: She was moaning and twitching, though...
                        Me: That was just her body flinching from the ant bite, Belle.
        Me: I didn't really hear her. She was pretty quiet.
            Belle: Really? Well, to me, it sounded like she moaned.
                Me: Are you sure? It really didn't sound like a moan to me.
                    Belle: I'm preeetty sure. I'm familiar with sounds like that...
                        Me: Everyone makes weird sounds when they're startled, Belle.
Narator: Buying your excuses, Belle stops her questioning.
Belle: Maybe you're right...
Naomi: Now I'm also starting to doubt my assumption...
Stacy: The flame is uncertain.
Me: (Good, it seems like they bought it.)
Me: If you really want to know, why not ask Violet later?
Naomi: Meh, I'm kinda over this...
Narator: As Belle is about to speak up again...
Narator: Eve approaches you and the girls.
Narator: Belle gives you a suspicious look, before continuing her questioning.
Belle: Something's fishy...
Belle: And, [m!t] stinks.
Me: Hey!
Me: I took a shower today!
Belle: You know what I meant...
Belle: Your excuses for Violet don't make sense...
Me: (I did a terrible job covering for her...)
Naomi: She was definitely moaning...
Stacy: However briefly it may have been.
Belle: [m!ct], now you only made us {i}more{/i} curious...
Narator: As Belle is about to speak up again...
Narator: Eve approaches you and the girls.
Belle: Another time, then.
Eve: Hello girls.
Eve: Did you enjoy your lunch?
Belle: Oh, heya.
Belle: The sandwiches were nice.
Naomi: They could have been better.
Eve: I'll make sure to tell the chef, Naomi.
Eve: Lunch is over, and the sessions are about to resume.
Eve: I actually came by to get Stacy for her session.
Stacy: Already?
Eve: Yes, Stacy.
Stacy: Are we going to do any pyro-therapy?
Eve: No...
Eve: Come with me, and you'll find out soon enough.
Eve: Naomi and Belle.
Eve: You two have free time until the barbecue.
Belle: Awesome, thanks!
Eve: As do you, [m!t].
Eve: Let's go, Stacy.
Eve: Goodbye, ladies.
Narator: Naomi and Belle return to their cabins as Eve walks away with Stacy.
Narator: Leaving you alone, to consider your next \"activity.\"
Me: (So, I have free time until the barbecue...)
Me: (Stacy is with Eve...)
Me: (Shit, Stacy is with Eve!)
Me: (What if she says something incriminating to Eve!)
Me: (She wouldn't. Definitely not on purpose...)
Me: (But, what if she accidentally lets something slip?)
Me: (I should trust her, though...)
Me: (She knows how important it is that this remain private...)
Me: *Sigh* (I could also just walk around camp a bit.)
Me: (Maybe that would ease my worries about Stacy.)
Me: (I wonder what they'll talk about.)
Me: (Maybe I can learn more about why Stacy is here...)
Me: (She never really explained that...)
Me: (Maybe she'd prefer I don't know...)
Me: (Secrets are burdens...) 
Me: (Especially other peoples' secrets.)
Me: (It's a pretty nice day. I could just take a walk around camp.)
            Me: (What should I do?)
            Me: (What should I do?)
Narator: Having walked around camp a bit... 
Narator: You return to the perimeter of the girls' campground.
Me: (Well, that was a nice walk.)
Me: (Didn't take too long, though...)
Me: (I doubt Stacy's session has even really gotten going...)
Narator: As you contemplate what to do next, you notice someone exit their cabin.
Me: (Oh, someone's coming outside.)
Me: (It's Naomi. I wonder what she's up to.)
Me: Feeling energized by your walk, you greet Naomi enthusiastically.
Me: Hey Naomi! What's up?
Naomi: Hey, [m!t]. Not much.
Naomi: Have you come to entertain me?
Me: You think that's the only reason I exist?
Naomi: I was convinced it was...
Naomi: Anyway, what're you doing back here?
Naomi: Miss me?
Me: I went for a walk...
Me: It just... ended up being a shorter walk than I expected.
Me: The camp isn't that big.
Naomi: Yeah, I could jog around this camp in 5 minutes...
Naomi: If I decided to jog, that is.
Naomi: *Quietly* I'd definitely never do it in this heat...
Naomi: Anyway, what's up?
Me: Not much. Killing time before the barbecue.
Naomi: Not spying on the other girls' sessions?
Me: *Chuckle* I'm breaking that habit.
Me: It's always an unpleasant surprise to be spotted...
Naomi: You must be familiar with that feeling by now, though.
Naomi: *Short laugh* I'm almost starting to think you like it...
Me: Trust me, I don't...
Me: I'd rather not get into those kinds of situations again.
Naomi: You sure?
Me: Certain.
Me: So, what were you about to do?
Me: Before I interrupted, that is.
Naomi: Oh, I don't know.
Naomi: I was looking for someone to entertain me.
Naomi: So, your arrival was truly perfect timing.
Me: Well, what would entertain you?
    Naomi: I don't know... Be spontaneous.
            Naomi: That isn't spontaneous... But, sure. Go ahead.
                Me: What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!
                    Naomi: That was probably the worst joke I've ever heard.
                            Naomi: Fine. I got one... My therapist says I have an obsession with vengeance. We'll see about that...
                                Me: {i}We'll see about--{/i} *Bursts out laughing* I get it. Good one!
                            Naomi: It's okay, kid. The showbiz life isn't for everyone.
                                Me: I think you're right. I should probably work the concession stand.
                                    Naomi: Maybe if you work hard, you can make it one day, kid.
                                        Me: Thanks, boss. I'm gonna make you proud, you'll see.
                Me: I wanted to buy camouflage pants, but I couldn't find any!
                    Naomi: *Chuckle* Okay, that was actually a decent joke.
                        Me: Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all summer.
        Me: I'm curious... Other than shopping, what are your hobbies?
            Naomi: Shopping is a lifestyle, not a hobby. I do have a few hobbies, though...
                    Naomi: Eww, no. No sports...
                            Naomi: Well, I do swim in our pool fairly often.
                                    Naomi: Maybe you'll get the chance... some day.
                                        Me: That would be awesome, Naomi... I hope it happens.
                                Me: Should I be surprised your castle has a pool?
                        Me: Ah yeah, I forgot. Sports would damage your precious skin...
                    Naomi: You're heading in the right direction...
                            Naomi: Bingo!
                                    Naomi: Well, just little things. Short stories... poems.
                                        Me: Well, I'd love to hear one of your poems sometime.
                                            Naomi: Look who's using his brain. You got me.
                                                Me: Wow, it was actually a pretty horrifying story.
                                                Me: More brain than you... The story wasn't even scary.
                                    Naomi: Really!
                                        Me: Woah. Well, I'm definitely interested in reading your writing.
                                        Me: Do you think I'm an idiot? You can't trick me...
                            Naomi: I do paint... But, that's not what I really enjoy doing.
                                    Naomi: I might be moonlighting as an amateur writer here and there...
                                        Me: Pretty cool. I'd love to read some of your stuff.
                                            Naomi: Oh, various formats... But, mainly short stories and poems.
                                                Me: So... I'm guessing your grandma didn't make up that story?
                                                    Naomi: You figured it out.
                                                        Me: Wow... That was actually a pretty scary story, Naomi.
                                                    Naomi: Oh, you know, haikus, sonnets... The usual.
Narator: You and Naomi warmly chat for a bit longer.
Narator: Both of you are enjoying the weather, and the company.
Naomi: You know, you're actually pretty cool, [m!t].
Me: Likewise, Naomi.
Me: I've learned a lot more about you...
Naomi: And?
Me: And, I like {i}who you are.{/i} I'm enjoying this.
Me: (Why does she hide these details about herself?)
Me: (Why does she maintain this ridiculous \"rich girl\" persona?)
Naomi: Thank you, [m!t].
Naomi: I'm also having a good time.
Naomi: But, I think our time is almost up.
Narator: Naomi points at Violet, walking up the path toward the campsite.
Naomi: Violet's done.
Me: Which means Eve will want to know where I am...
Naomi: Probably. She {i}is{/i} that way.
Me: Well, it was a pleasure, Naomi.
Naomi: Toodles, [m!t]!
Narator: You wave Naomi goodbye, as you walk back toward the house.
Me: (Human beings are complex creatures...)
Narator: Naomi isn't happy to hear what you said.
Naomi: You're a dick, [m!t].
Naomi: Get the hell out of here...
Narator: Naomi shoos you away before crossing her arms and walking back to her cabin.
Me: (So, she doesn't appreciate honesty?)
Me: (Then again, I was being pretty rude to her...)
Me: (It was a bit uncalled for...)
Me: (Oh well, she'll get over it.)
Narator: Feeling slightly ashamed by how you handled that, you head back to the house.
Narator: Naomi looks you in the eyes briefly, before looking away smiling.
Narator: You feel that this was a moment of true connection, between you two.
Me: (What was that look?)
Me: (It was... tender.)
Naomi: [m!t]...
Me: Yeah?
Naomi: I'm having a really great time with you.
Me: Me too, Naomi.
Me: You're really fun to be around.
Naomi: (He's so sweet to me...)
Naomi: Aww...
Me: What is it?
Naomi: I think our time is up.
Narator: Naomi points at Violet, walking up the path toward the campsite.
Naomi: Violet's done...
Me: Which means Eve will want to know where I am...
Naomi: Probably. She {i}is{/i} that way.
Me: I hope we can spend more time like this, Naomi.
Me: (Maybe, we can spend time getting {i}even closer.{/i})
Naomi: Toodles, [m!t]!
Naomi: (Let's get to know each other on a {i}deeper{/i} level next time...)
Narator: You wave Naomi goodbye, as you walk back toward the house.
Me: (Human beings are beautiful, complex creatures...)
Narator: As you approach the back of the house...
Narator: You see Eve and Stacy through the plate glass windows of the Community Area.
Me: (There they are...)
Narator: Fueled by your fear, your mind goes into espionage-mode...
Me: (I need to find a good hiding spot...)
Me: (A spot that could give me the most insight while keeping me hidden.)
Me: (If I find a good angle out here I can watch them but not hear them...)
Me: (But, if I go inside, I could get caught...)
Me: (What to do...)
Me: (What to do... What to do...)
    Me: (What to do... What to do...)
        Me: (I better not risk getting closer...)
        Me: (Even though I'm worried Stacy will say something to Eve...)
        Me: (Maybe I'm just overthinking this...)
        Me: (Better hide, though.)
        Narator: You quickly hide in a bush in eyeshot of the Community Area.
        Me: (This spot is perfect.)
        Me: (I can still see their session, but they'd never see me.)
        Narator: Through the window, from your bush, you see Eve pull out a stack of cards.
        Me: (What are they doing?)
        Narator: A second later, as if answering your question, Eve pulls a card from the stack.
        Narator: She holds it up with the ink blot on the card facing Stacy.
        Me: (Aha... Rorschach testing.)
        Me: (I doubt Stacy can say anything that would make Eve suspicious.)
        Me: (I wonder what she sees in them, though...)
        Narator: As you watch Eve pull the cards, and Stacy responding...
        Narator: Your curiosity gets you thinking about what she could be saying.
        Me: (I bet she sees...)
        Me: (A fireplace.)
        Me: (A pile of ash.)
        Me: (A shower of sparks.)
        Me: (A... flower?)
        Me: (A rising phoenix.)
        Narator: Eve lowers the final card, and writes something down on a clipboard.
        Narator: She then smiles at Stacy, and stands up.
        Me: (Oh, are they done already?)
        Narator: Stacy stands up, and Eve walks her to the back door.
        Narator: Stacy exits the house, and Eve enters her office.
        Me: (Shit! Into the bush!)
        Narator: You duck into the bush, just as Stacy rounds the corner from the deck.
        Narator: She seems to notice your bush rustling...
        Narator: ...but, she shrugs it off and continues walking away.
        Me: (Oh thank sweet baby Jesus. She didn't notice me.)
        Narator: As you peek your head out of the bush, you notice Violet approaching.
        Me: (Oh shit, Violet!)
        Narator: You quickly duck back into the bush.
        Me: (I don't think she saw me, either.)
        Me: (I'm so stealthy, they should call me \"The Shadow.\")
        Narator: You wait in the bush until you hear Violet's footsteps pass you.
        Me: (Just a little further, and I can peek out again.)
        Narator: You hear a door open, then close.
        Narator: Soon after, you feel it's safe enough to look.
        Me: (She's inside.)
        Me: (Oh, they're going into Eve's office.)
        Me: (It's probably going to be a more private session...)
        Me: (I wonder how Eve will help Violet.)
        Me: (Eve's therapies have been pretty interesting today.)
        Me: (But, I shouldn't do that to Violet...)
        Me: (Agh! The conundrum!)
        Narator: Still considering what to do, you carefully exit the bush.
        Me: (Should I spy on Violet's session, or not?)
            Me: (Should I spy on Violet's session, or not?)
                Me: (I reeeeally wonder what her session will be...)
                Narator: Unsurprisingly, your curiosity gets the better of you.
                Me: (As long as I stay hidden, I'll be fine.)
                Me: (And nobody will find out.)
                Me: (No harm, no foul.)
                Narator: As you reassure yourself that you're in the right, Eve begins speaking.
                Me: (I really shouldn't...)
                Me: (It just doesn't feel right spying on such a good girl...)
                Me: (Plus...)
                Me: (If Violet caught me, she'd never forgive me.)
                Me: (Guess I'll have to find something else to do.)
                Me: (Something less devious.)
                Narator: As you walk toward the front of the house, you see Stacy down the path.
        Me: (Hmm... I'll hear more if I hide closer.)
        Narator: Convinced by your reasoning, you go toward the deck.
        Me: (Hopefully she doesn't say anything about last night...)
        Me: (I guess the only way I'll really know...)
        Me: (...is if I go inside.)
        Me: (It looks like they'll hold the session here...)
        Me: (That means I can hide in Eve's office.)
        Me: (Hope she doesn't come in here...)
        Narator: You cautiously enter Eve's office.
        Narator: Making sure to leave the door ajar, to hear them better.
        Me: (This is perfect.)
        Me: (Eve can't see me.)
        Me: (But, I can hear and see them perfectly.)
        Narator: Unbeknownst to you at the time, Stacy could see you.
        Eve: Please, Stacy. Take a seat.
        Stacy: Of course.
        Stacy: What will we be doing today?
        Eve: Well, based on the results of your pre-evaluation...
        Eve: I believe Rorschach testing will be most impactful, for you.
        Eve: Have you ever done this kind of testing, Stacy?
        Stacy: No, I have not.
        Eve: Well, it's really simple.
        Eve: I'll show you some cards with ink blots on them.
        Eve: And, all you have to do is tell me honestly what you see.
        Stacy: Why would people be dishonest?
        Eve: To hide themselves from their therapist.
        Eve: Usually due to personal anxieties or neuroses.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_539522c4.mp3
        Stacy: Well, my flock and I are honest.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_1164e125.mp3
        Stacy: That is one of our core tenants.
        Me: (Thankfully she's only doing Rorschach testing...)
        Me: (I doubt Stacy would even be able to spill anything critical.)
        Eve: So, do you have any questions?
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_87f2abdd.mp3
        Stacy: Nope. We can begin.
        Eve: Excellent.
        Narator: Eve's hand moves down toward the pile of cards, pulling the top one.
        Narator: She holds it up toward Stacy.
        Me: (Crap, I can't see what the ink blotch looks like...)
        Me: (Oh well. Her responses are all that matter, anyway.)
        Eve: What do you see?
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_07383f23.mp3
        Stacy: I see... A warmly glowing light.
        Eve: Okay.
        Eve: What do you see now?
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_e395f6d9.mp3
        Stacy: I see a crimson lotus emerging from a bed of ashes.
        Eve: Interesting...
        Eve: And, now?
        Narator: Stacy looks at the card, glances in your direction quickly, then back, and answers.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_41ed9463.mp3
        Stacy: I see... A young man peeking through the crack in a door.
        Me: (WHAT?!)
        Narator: A sudden, sharp feeling of terror strikes you in the chest.
        Me: (SHIT, SHIT, SHIT!)
        Eve: Hmm?
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_1ffe8975.mp3
        Stacy: I'm just joking about that one.
        Narator: Your panic subsides, as you realize Stacy won't rat you out.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_2ae07b46.mp3
        Stacy: I see... A golden sunset, and a trail of rising smoke.
        Eve: Okay. That's it for today.
        Eve: I think I got enough, from you.
        Eve: This will be extremely valuable in your therapy.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_b9596b59.mp3
        Stacy: That's great...
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_bc6cccd9.mp3
        Stacy: (I don't {i}need{/i} therapy...)
        Narator: You watch as Eve stands, beckoning Stacy to follow-suit.
        Eve: Let me walk you to the door.
        Me: (Time to bail!) 
        Me: (But where, they'll see me if I go through the door!)
        Narator: You immediately look toward the office window.
        Me: (Out the window!)
        Narator: You quickly slide the window open, and hop over the window-sill.
        Narator: Just as Eve and Stacy approach the back door.
        Eve: Oh? Who left this door open?
        Eve: (Maybe Kiara, or Emily.)
        Narator: Eve closes the office door, and Stacy exits the Community Area onto the deck.
        Eve: You have a bit of time before the barbecue tonight.
        Eve: Enjoy yourself, until then.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_fe3ef262.mp3
        Stacy: Thank you. Bye, Eve.
        Narator: Stacy walks away from the Community Area.
        Narator: As she does, she spots Violet approaching and they stop to talk.
        Stacy: Hello, Violet!
        Violet: Hey, Stacy. How was your session?
        Narator: Realizing you'd be spotted spying if they turned around...
        Narator: ...you lie down behind the outdoor couch.
        Stacy: My session was interesting. Very enlightening.
        Violet: That's good. Well, I gotta go.
        voice voice/e6MCFollBore_94712097.mp3
        Violet: Don't want to keep Eve waiting...
        Stacy: Goodbye, Violet. See you later!
        Narator: Violet continues on toward the deck...
        Narator: Luckily, she doesn't notice you.
        Narator: Soon after, you hear her enter the house.
        Me: (I wonder where her session will be held...)
        Narator: Now squatting behind the couch, you get your answer almost immediately...
        Narator: The office door opens.
        Me: (Oh, they'll be in her office, I guess...)
        Me: (It's probably going to be a more private session...)

    Me: (What to do... What to do...)
        Me: (I think I'll get enough entertainment out here.)
        Me: (I can't just stand out here in the open, though...)
        Me: (Maybe the bush?)
        Narator: You quickly hide in a bush in eyeshot of the Community Area.
        Me: (This spot is perfect.)
        Me: (I can still see their session, but they'd never see me.)

        Me: (I bet she sees...)
        Me: *Thinking in Stacy's voice* (A flaaaming log.)
        Me: *Thinking in Stacy's voice* (A pile of the softest ash.)
        Me: *Thinking in Stacy's voice* (A hot shower of sparks.)
        Me: *Thinking in Stacy's voice* (A glooowing ember.)
        Me: *Thinking in Stacy's voice* (The Heavenly Phoenix Lotus!)
        Narator: Eve lowers the final card, and writes something down on a clipboard.
        Narator: She then smiles at Stacy, and stands up.

        Narator: A sudden, sharp feeling of terror strikes you in the chest.
        Me: (SHIT, SHIT, SHIT!)

        Me: (Oh, they'll be in her office, I guess...)
        Me: (It's probably going to be a more private session...)
        Me: (I wonder how Eve will help Violet.)
        Me: (Eve's therapies have been pretty interesting today.)
        Me: (But, I shouldn't do that to Violet...)
        Me: (Agh! The conundrum!)
        Narator: Still considering what to do, you carefully exit the bush.
        Me: (Should I spy on Violet's session, or not?)
            Me: (Hmm...)
                Me: (I reeeeally wonder what her session will be...)
                Narator: Unsurprisingly, your curiosity gets the better of you.
                Me: (As long as I stay hidden, I'll be fine.)
                Me: (And nobody will find out.)
                Me: (No harm, no foul.)
                Narator: As you reassure yourself that you're in the right, Eve begins speaking.
                Me: (I reeeeally wonder what her session will be...)
                Narator: Unsurprisingly, your curiosity gets the better of you. 
                Me: (As long as I stay hidden, I'll be fine.)
                Me: (And nobody will find out.)
                Me: (No harm, no foul.)
                Narator: As you reassure yourself that you're in the right, Eve begins speaking.
Me: (I could go hang out with Stacy a bit.)
Me: (The couch seems pretty inviting right now, too...)
Me: (Despite the house's lack of air conditioning.)
        Me: At which door should I enter?
Narator: You enter the main house through the back door.
Narator: Eve is sitting on the couch, reading a book.
Eve: Huh?
Eve: Oh. Hello, [m!t].
Eve: Got tired of using the front door?
Me: I realized this door gets neglected a lot.
Me: So, I chose to take the {i}scenic route{/i}.
Eve: I see.
Eve: I too like to take the road less traveled.
Eve: Anyway, how's your day going?
Me: Pretty good...
Me: Happy to not be doing constant chores for once.
Eve: I'm glad you're enjoying your mostly-off day.
Eve: You'll need that energy for the days to come.
Narator: You open the front door, and step inside the house.
Narator: Immediately, you notice Eve sitting on the couch, reading a book.
Me: Hey, Eve.
Eve: Hi, [m!t]. How's your day going?
Me: Pretty good...
Me: Happy to not be doing constant chores for once.
Eve: I'm glad you're enjoying your mostly-off day.
Eve: You'll need that energy for the days to come.
Eve: Wanna join me on the couch?
Eve: Relax, maybe chat a little?
Me: Sure
Me: What's... up?
Me: Someone's relaxed.
Eve: Well, because I have nothing to worry about.
Me: (Fuck...)
Me: (If she knew what the girls have been doing...)
Me: That's good to hear, Eve.
Narator: Eve places her book on the coffee table, and turns to you.
Eve: Well, aren't you going to sit down?
Me: Ah, if you insist.
Eve: Come on, [m!t]. I don't bite.
Eve: Take a load off.
Narator: You abide by Eve's request, and take a seat on the couch.
Eve: So, how's your day been?
Eve: Hopefully you haven't been working too hard.
Eve: *Chuckle* Or, working too little?
Me: I mean, I didn't have any tasks assigned to me.
Eve: I'm just messing with you, don't worry.
Me: You seem pretty relaxed today...
Me: Something nice happen?
Eve: Why, yes, actually.
Eve: The nicest thing that {i}could{/i} happen.
Eve: The patients' therapies are going smoothly.
Me: Well, that's good to hear.
Me: Do you think all of them will be cured?
Eve: Well, certain cases are more difficult than others to remedy...
Eve: But, yes. I think we will help them all.
Me: That's great to hear.
    Eve: So, how has college been?
            Eve: That's good to hear. Any classes giving you difficulties?
                Me: Not really. Things only get hard in the final year.
                    Eve: You're right about that. I remember my first years of college fondly...
                        Me: Oh, yeah? Tell me a story from your \"glory days.\"
                            Eve: Well, what kind of story do you want to hear?
                                    Eve: Oh, I don't know... My college days weren't very eventful.
                                        Me: You sure? You've gotta have some good stories.
                        Me: Were your classmates dinosaurs, by any chance?
                            Eve: Oooooh... Very original. No, I'm not that old...
                                    Eve: Good to see some self-awareness...
                                        Me: *Chuckle* You know that's not my strong suit.
                                        Me: *Quietly* You'd benefit from a healthy dose of that, too...
                    Eve: Which class?
                            Eve: Oh, come on. You can't be serious...
                                    Eve: Really? Even after all those summers hearing my \"free lectures?\"
                                        Me: You know, I didn't really get all that psycho-babble.
                                        Me: I guess it all just went in one ear and out the other.
                                    Eve: *Soft chuckle* You're quite the comedian.
                                            Eve: What's so difficult about it?
                                                Me: There are just so many formulas you need to memorize...
                                                Me: Well, one tiny mistake becomes a huge error on a test...
                        Me: Well... Math was always my weakest subject.
                            Eve: Where do you struggle with math?
                                Me: One mistake has a snowball effect in multipart problems...
            Eve: Ups and downs?
                    Eve: That's great to hear! Care to share?
                        Me: I always feel amazing after getting 90%% or more on exams.
                            Eve: Of course, that's something to be proud of.
                        Me: Yeah, I've spent time with two really great girls...
                            Eve: *Chuckle* Woah, there! You're quite the player, huh?
                                Me: *Chuckle* I didn't mean at the same time, Eve.
                    Eve: Sorry to hear that... You want to talk about it?
                        Me: Sure... Recently, Jane and I ended whatever we had going...
                            Eve: Well, that's a shame... What caused it?
                                Me: She thought there was a rift forming between us...
    Eve: I swear, if you tell anyone what I tell you...
    Me: I won't tell a soul.
    Eve: I'll hold you to that.
    Eve: Well, okay. Here it goes...
    Eve: When I was in college, I joined a sorority...
    Eve: It wasn't one of those sororities you see in the movies.
    Eve: I was quite timid, even a bit of a bookworm, back then.
    Eve: Our sorority house was kind of... unusual.
    Eve: Something in between a study group and a party house.
    Me: (Party nerds?)
    Eve: I know what you're thinking.
    Eve: \"Sounds boring.\"
    Me: Well, no--
    Eve: I wouldn't disagree with you, but the parties some of our girls threw...
    Eve: Well, when they happened, they were the talk of the campus.
    Me: I'm listening...
    Eve: Hmm... Okay. I know the perfect party to tell you about.
    Eve: It was a pretty hot autumn, and getting close to Halloween...
    Eve: We were just about finished with our midterms...
    Eve: And, so eager to let our hair down a little.
    Eve: So, we decided to organize a party at our house.
    Eve: We decorated the place to look like an old Victorian manor...
    Me: Sounds spooky.
    Eve: Oh, it was.
    Eve: The cherry on top involved the old stone pond in the back yard...
    Me: A pond?
    Eve: I'll get to that...
    Me: Okay, okay.
    Eve: So, we had our friends pass our fliers, and spread the word...
    Eve: By nightfall, tons of people were congregating on the front lawn.
    Eve: We started letting them in, and within an hour the house was full.
    Eve: The music was loud, the drinks flowing...
    Me: (Sounds like a bumpin' party.)
    Eve: As the night went on, the perfect time was approaching...
    Eve: One of my housemates got the partygoers' attention...
    Eve: And, that was our cue.
    Eve: A few housemates and I threw these huge blocks of dry ice into the pond.
    Eve: Which, in turn, released the spookiest-looking fog.
    Eve: The girls went wild.
    Eve: Within moments they were jumping into the pond, splashing around...
    Me: (Damn, that sounds like a Halloween party at the Playboy mansion...)
    Eve: We lost control of the partygoers. They got pretty rowdy...
    Eve: The party was shut down around 3am...
    Eve: Ah... What a night.
    Me: (Looks like Eve has a wild side.)
    Eve: My most difficult class...
    Eve: Hmm...
    Eve: You know, I'd probably have to say neurobiology.
    Eve: (Neurobiology? And, I thought math was hard...)
    Eve: Yeah, it's definitely neurobiology.
    Eve: There was this one term I was studying like a maniac...
    Eve: All for this one final exam.
    Me: Neurobiology?
    Eve: Yeah. The teacher was an old codger...
    Eve: Nearly blind, and very... {i}traditional{/i}.
    Me: Was he teaching during The Renaissance?
    Eve: *Chuckle* You know? He might have.
    Eve: Anyway... He wanted us to practically memorize the entire textbook...
    Eve: All the terminology, all the theories and systems...
    Eve: By the second week of studying, I was truly losing my marbles.
    Eve: I hadn't slept in 3 days, and barely eaten much food...
    Eve: I was a machine built to study, and fueled by that sweet black liquid...
    Me: Coffee.
    Eve: Exactly. I was a machine and coffee was my fuel.
    Eve: So, finally the day came...
    Eve: I sat down, looked around at all the other panicked students.
    Eve: The old man showed up, passed out the exams, and smiled...
    Me: (What an ass...)
    Eve: He got some sick joy in failing students.
    Eve: And, the look of abject terror on the young faces in front of him.
    Eve: There are some professors out there that make that their goal...
    Eve: I, personally, see that as a sign of that professor's failure.
    Eve: Back to the point...
    Eve: I focused, filled in the exam to the best of my abilities, and turned it in.
    Me: And?
    Eve: And, I ended up getting a 95 %% and rubbing it in his face, subtlely.
    Me: Nice!
    Me: That's one of the best ways to stick it to a teacher like that.
    Eve: Yeah. Yeah, it is...
    Eve: I'm sorry to hear that, [m!t]...
    Eve: I can sympathize with you.
    Eve: I've had my fair share of heartbreak throughout my life...
    Me: Yeah?
    Eve: Yeah.
    Eve: It gets better. Just give it time.
    Me: Thanks, Eve...
    Narator: Eve looks annoyed by your rude comment.
    Eve: And here I thought you had matured...
    Eve: You still have some work to do.
    Narator: You roll your eyes at Eve, and both of you go quiet.
    Eve: A young Casanova, you say?
    Eve: (I hope he's not trying anything with the patients...)
    Me: It's just something a friend of mine called me.
    Eve: But, why would he call you that?
    Eve: Don't you know what that means, ladykiller?
    Me: Oh, that's what it means?
    Me: I thought they made that phrase up.
    Eve: Of course they didn't...
    Eve: That phrase refers to to Giovanni Giacomo.
    Eve: A figure from history often portrayed as a womanizer.
    Me: *Chuckle* Oh, I'm definitely not that.
    Eve: (Yeah, I really hope you aren't...)
    Eve: Well, your friend must have been calling you that ironically, then.
    Me: People {i}do{/i} love to make me the butt of jokes.
    Eve: I won't push it...
    Eve: Whatever it is, though... I'm sorry it happened.
    Me: Thanks, Eve.
    Eve: I'm here for you, [m!t].
    Me: I really appreciate it.
Narator: Suddenly, you both hear the beeping noise of a phone alarm...
Narator: Which interrupts the conversation you were having with Eve.
Eve: Oh, would you look at the time.
Eve: Sorry, [m!t]. Looks like our time is up.
Me: (Now I feel like one of her patients...)
Me: (Talking with a deadline.)
Me: It's fine. What's the alarm for?
Eve: It's a little head's-up that we need to start preparing the barbecue.
Me: You're probably going to need my help, huh?
Eve: *Chuckle* How'd you know, Mr. Chef?
Me: I'm going to be the grillmaster?
Eve: Yes you are.
Me: Cool.
Eve: Anyway, let's go.
Eve: Kiara should be meeting us in the kitchen, shortly.
Narator: You follow Eve the short distance into the kitchen.
Narator: Deciding to follow Stacy, you jog after her, down the path.
Me: Hey, Stacy!
Me: Wait up!
Narator: You quickly catch up to Stacy, who greets you with a happy smile.
Stacy: Hello, [m!t].
Stacy: What are you doing running after me?
Me: I saw you down the path, and decided to see what you're up to.
Stacy: Oh, you want to spend time with me?
Me: Maybe...
Me: My main thought {i}was{/i} just to say hello.
Me: You may change my mind, though.
Stacy: I enjoy the time we spend together.
Stacy: And, well...
Eve: Hello, Violet.
Eve: How are you today?
Violet: Hi, Dr. Eve. I'm doing well, thank you.
Violet: How are you?
Eve: I'm fine, thanks for asking.
Eve: Well, Violet...
Eve: You know that your situation is far more... sensitive.
Violet: Yes... I know.
Eve: Because of this, the kinds of therapies available to you are limited.
Violet: Oh...
Eve: Don't be disheartened, Violet.
Eve: I'll do my best to help you.
Eve: In fact, I think I have an idea what might help...
Violet: That's wonderful.
Eve: However, it will take your complete cooperation.
Me: (Complete cooperation?)
Eve: Despite how odd it may be to you, at first.
Violet: Odd?
Eve: Well, not exactly {i}odd.{/i}
Eve: Rather, something you may not be used to.
Violet: Okay, I'll give you my complete cooperation.
Eve: Excellent. Then, we can begin...
Eve: Today, you will only go through a preliminary hypnotherapy session.
Eve: We want to ease you into it, so there are no adverse side-effects.
Violet: Side-effects?
Eve: You really don't need to worry about them.
Me: (I wonder what those side-effects are...)
Eve: We'll take this slowly, to properly {i}acclimate{/i} your mind, so to speak.
Violet: Okay, I trust you.
Violet: I have been feeling better since arriving here...
Eve: You have quite a journey still.
Violet: I know. I'm ready to conquer this challenge.
Narator: You reposition yourself underneath the window...
Narator: A spot where you have a better vantage point.
Me: (I can see them fine, from here.)
Me: (Not the best, but better than my last angle.)
Narator: As you peer through the window once more... 
Narator: ...you see Eve take something out of her pocket.
Me: (What's that?)
Eve: This is a simple pendulum.
Eve: I'll need you to focus on it as it swings.
Eve: And, listen to me very carefully.
Violet: Okay...
Me: (She's doing hypnotherapy on Violet?)
Me: (This is gonna be interesting...)
Eve: In a moment, I am going to ease you into relaxation.
Narator: Eve begins swinging the pendulum as she speaks more calmly.
Eve: Follow the pendulum with your eyes, and listen to my voice.
Eve: I am going to count down from ten, to one.
Violet: Okay...
Eve: The moment I say the number ten, you will let your eyelids grow heavy...
Eve: ...allowing them to close, and remain closed.
Violet: Yes...
Eve: The moment I say the number ten...
Eve: ...you will, in your mind, see yourself atop a set of stairs.
Eve: The moment I say the number nine, and every other number counting down...
Eve: You will move down those stairs, relaxing more with each step.
Violet: Mhm...
Eve: At the bottom of the stairs is a large, comfortable bed.
Eve: A bed with silky sheets, and feathered pillows.
Violet: Sounds pleasant...
Eve: The moment I say the number one...
Eve: ...you will sink into the bed, and rest your head on the soft pillow.
Eve: Follow the pendulum...
Eve: Starting with ten... Let your eyes grow heavy...
Eve: Ten... Your eyes grow heavier.
Eve: Nine... You're relaxing, and letting go.
Eve: Eight... Sink into a more comfortable position.
Eve: Seven...
Eve: Six... Another step...
Eve: Five... You're calm, and relaxing more.
Eve: Four...
Eve: Three... Breathe in slowly.
Eve: Two... You're nearly at the luxurious bed...
Eve: One... 
Eve: Let yourself sink into the comfortable bed...
Eve: Let every muscle go limp and loose, as you sink into calmness.
Eve: Good, gooood...
Narator: Eve puts the pendulum down, before speaking once more.
Eve: How do you feel, Violet?
Violet: I feel... Relaxed.
Eve: That's great.
Eve: Listen to my voice...
Violet: I am listening to your voice.
Eve: Good.
Eve: Now that you're relaxed, I am going to give you affirmations...
Me: (Hmm? Affirmations?)
Eve: ...and, you will embrace them fully.
Violet: I will embrace them fully.
Me: (Woah, okay... This is getting interesting.)
Eve: First, we will begin with simple affirmations...
Eve: These will modify your behavior...
Eve: Both conscious and subconscious.
Me: (What the hell is Eve doing?)
Me: (This sounds like some MK ULTRA shit...)
Eve: You are relaxed.
Violet: I am relaxed.
Eve: You are emerging...
Violet: I am emerging...
Me: (Emerging?)
Eve: ...from your shell.
Violet: ...from my shell.
Me: (This is so weird...)
Eve: You are comfortable at Red Falls.
Violet: I am comfortable at Red Falls.
Eve: You are comfortable with the other girls.
Violet: I am comfortable with the other girls.
Me: (She's suggesting for Violet to become more... open?)
Eve: You are comfortable with your body.
Violet: I am comfotable with my body.
Eve: You are not triggered by clapping, anymore.
Violet: I am not triggered by clapping, anymore.
Me: (Oh...)
Me: (I think I see where Eve is taking this...)
Eve: Now, Violet... I'm going to test something...
Violet: Now... Violet... I'm going to--
Me: (Heh, this is actually kinda funny.)
Eve: No, no. Please don't repeat this.
Violet: Okay.
Narator: Eve slowly raises her hands in front of herself...
Narator: Looking concerned, and acting cautiously, Eve claps twice.
Me: (Uh-oh...)
Violet: Mmmff... Ahh...
Me: (Eve just made Violet... cum!)
Me: (What the hell?!)
Eve: *Quietly* Damn. I hoped that would help...
Eve: You are calm. You are relaxed.
Violet: I am... calm. I'm... relaxed.
Eve: I will count up to three...
Eve: On three... You will come back to us, and open your eyes.
Violet: I will come back...
Eve: One...
Eve: Two...
Eve: Three.
Narator: Violet opens her eyes, as Eve says three.
Eve: Welcome back, Violet.
Eve: How do you feel?
Violet: I... uhh...
Violet: I feel a bit weird... 
Violet: But... also really relaxed.
Me: (This was the most bizarre session yet...)
Me: (I think I've seen {i}too much.{/i})
Narator: As you crouch to sneak away...
Narator: You hear someone whisper in your ear.
Stacy: *Whisper* What are you dooooing?
Me: *Quiet gasp* Aah. Uh, hey Stacy.
Narator: Attempting to divert attion from what you were doing...
Narator: You bear hug Stacy, pulling her away from the window.
Me: I'm so happy to see you!
Stacy: I am pleased to see you too, [m!t].
Me: (That was pretty smooth...)
Me: (But, I'm probably not out of the woods yet.)
Narator: You put your arm over Stacy's shoulder and walk her to the front of the house.
    Stacy: What were you doing over there?
            Stacy: Are you... watching Violet?
                    Stacy: Oh? For tribute?
                            Stacy: Who are you paying tribute to?
            Stacy: Oh? You wish to pay tribute to the divine flame?
                    Stacy: I'm certain you will succeed. Do you require help?
                            Stacy: The ashen kings? One does not pay tribute to them...
                Me: Yeah, I just wanted to get closer to the ashy kings.
                    Stacy: The ashy kings? One does not pay tribute to them...
                        Me: Ah, you're right. I misspoke. I meant the flame... of creation.
Narator: Stacy scowls at you suspiciously...
Stacy: I feel as though...
Stacy: You're being deceitful.
Me: I swear, I'm telling you the truth.
Stacy: (The flame never lies...)
Stacy: I am disheartened by your actions... [m!t].
Stacy: It will take some time for the flame to forgive your dishonesty.
Me: (Shit, I didn't convince her...)
Me: I'm sorry, Stacy...
Stacy: I must leave you, now.
Stacy: See you at the barbecue.
Narator: Without actually saying goodbye, Stacy walks away sullenly.
Stacy: (Why was he... watching her?)
Stacy: (What does he think of her...)
Stacy: (Heavenly... please guide me...)
Me: (She may burn me alive in my sleep for this...)
Me: *Shudder*
Narator: Realizing you messed up, you walk over to the front steps.
Narator: Sitting on the front steps of the house, you collect your thoughts.
Me: (I hope she'll forgive me...)
Narator: However, you are interrupted by Violet walking toward you.
Violet: Hey, [m!t]! What's wrong?
Me: Oh, nothing. I'm just feeling a bit tired...
Violet: That's too bad. It's such a nice day!
Violet: We have a little free time before the barbecue...
Violet: I might take a dip in the lake. It's pretty refreshing.
Violet: If you're feeling up for it, you could join me?
Me: Huh? Oh... no, I can't.
Me: I think I'm needed here.
Violet: (Oh, that's such a shame...)
Violet: (Why am I feeling so... open?)
Violet: See you later, then.
Me: See you, Violet.
Me: (Why was she being so open with me?)
Me: (She's usually so shy...)
Me: (Odd.)
Narator: Violet walks away from you and down the path, energetically.
Stacy: Aaahh...
Stacy: I am happy...
Me: Oh?
Stacy: I am happy to be here, with you.
Stacy: You seem to respect my beliefs...
Stacy: I am not used to this.
Stacy: At best... most people just mock us...
Stacy: At worst, they threaten us with violence...
Stacy: ...sometimes acting on their violent impulses.
Me: I'm sorry to hear that, Stacy...
Narator: Stacy becomes more cheerful, in an attempt to ease your mind.
Stacy: Oh, do not worry. We are strong in body and spirit.
Me: (You sure are...)
Narator: You walk with Stacy to the front of the house.
Stacy: [m!ct]... I have an idea.
Stacy: Will you hear me out?
Me: Sure, Stacy.
Stacy: I would like to spend more time with you.
Stacy: We still have some free time before the barbecue this evening, you know?
Me: (I wonder where this is going...)
Me: Yes?
Stacy: I would like you to come with me... somewhere.
Me: Will you tell me where we're going?
Stacy: *Giggle* That would ruin half the fun.
Stacy: Do you trust me?
Me: (That's a good question...)
Me: (Do I?)
Stacy: Well... Do you?
Me: I do, Stacy.
Stacy: Good. Then, will you join me?
Me: (Hmm... Will I?)
    Me: (Hmm... Will I?)
        Me: You know what?
        Stacy: Oh?
        Me: I'll join you, Stacy.
        Narator: You see a glimmer in Stacy's eyes as you say this.
        Stacy: Oh, wonderful!
        Stacy: Take my hand.
        Narator: As you grab Stacy's hand, she guides you off the path...
        Narator: ...and back to her secret spot.
        Stacy: We're here. This is my secret place.
        Me: Your secret place?
        Stacy: Yes. I found this place the first day I got here.
        Stacy: I come here to get away from the others, and commune with my deities.
        Me: I thought you needed fire for that.
        Stacy: Oh, no. 
        Stacy: Not every kind of communication requires a burning connection.
        Me: Interesting...
        Stacy: There are other forms of connection...
        Stacy: ...that allow divine communication.
        Me: (Is she--)
        Narator: Stacy comes closer to you, and embraces you.
        Narator: Her lips kiss your neck sensually
        Narator: Then meet your lips.
        Stacy: Touch me...
        Me: Okay.
        Narator: You touch Stacy's breast, as she begins touching herself.
        Stacy: We can't bask in the heat of pleasure for too long...
        Stacy: The others may become suspicious.
        Me: You read my mind, Stacy.
        Me: (Seems she's starting to get the M.O.)
        Narator: She drops to her knees, while continuing to touch herself...
        Narator: ...only stopping to pull down your pants, exposing your member to her.
        Me: (Fuck yeah... I really like this pacing...)
        Stacy: You're filling up... with the warmth of pleasure.
        Narator: Stacy places her hand around your cock, and begins stroking it.
        Stacy: Do you enjoy this?
        Me: Oh yeah... This is nice, Stacy.
        Narator: She continues stroking you methodically, and with intent.
        Narator: It appears she enjoys this almost as much as you do.
        Stacy: I think you'll like {i}this.{/i}
        Me: Hmm? Wha--
        Narator: Before you can even finish your thought...
        Narator: You're thrust into the realm of intense pleasure,
        Narator: as Stacy takes your cock into her mouth.
        Me: *Moan* Aaaahhh... Yeah...
        Stacy: Mmmm...
        Narator: Stacy continues sucking your long, hard cock...
        Narator: Taking it as deep down her throat as she can.
        Stacy: Gglgl...
        Me: Aaah... Fuck...
        Narator: Stacy sucks you off so well, you're peaking before you know it.
        Narator: And, never having stopped touching herself, Stacy is too.
        Me: I'm gonna...
        Stacy: *Muffled* Give... me--
        Narator: Before Stacy can finish her muffled request, you orgasm...
        Narator: ...releasing a huge load of cum into her throat.
        Me: *Moan* Aaaah...
        Narator: As she takes your load she gasps in orgasm.
        Stacy: *Gasp* Mmmmf! Aah!
        Narator: Her tongue falls out of her mouth, her body in pure ecstacy...
        Narator: However, even in orgasm... 
        Narator: ...she makes sure to close her mouth, swallowing the rest of your load.
        Me: (Shit, that was intense...)
        Stacy: Did you enjoy this, [m!t]?
        Me: Yeah, I really did...
        Stacy: Did I send sparks flying through you?
        Me: You could say that...
        Stacy: Good... You filled me with the sparks of passion, too.
        Stacy: I fear our time is up.
        Narator: Stacy stands up and wipes cum of her face, allowing you to pull up your pants.
        Me: I think you're right...
        Me: I hope we get to do something like this again, though.
        Stacy: Oh? You do?
        Stacy: Then, we'll make sure to spice it up next time.
        Stacy: You should go that way.
        Stacy: It's the quickest path back to the house.
        Me: Thanks, Stacy.
        Me: How... do you know that?
        Stacy: I've been exploring.
        Stacy: *Giggle* Goodbye, my fiery prince.
        Me: See you later, hot stuff.
        Narator: You both go your separate ways.
        Narator: Stacy notices the look of conflict in your eyes.
        Stacy: Oh...
        Stacy: It saddens me...
        Me: Yeah, I really can't...
        Me: I'm sorry, Stacy.
        Stacy: It's okay...
        Stacy: There will be other moments for us to share.
        Me: (She really enjoys my company...)
        Me: (And, I'm starting to enjoy hers.)
        Narator: Stacy leaves you, and heads back toward the girls' campground.
        Me: (I should probably head back to the house...)
Narator: Standing outside the house, you stretch your legs.
Me: (Ah, it's been an {i}eventful day...{/i})
Me: (I should go inside.)
Me: (Hopefully Eve hasn't been wondering where I am...)
        Me: Through which door should I enter?
Narator: You walk through the front door.
Narator: At first, you notice no one...
Me: Nobody's home...
Narator: Soon after, however, Eve appears...
Narator: Confirming your worst fears.
Eve: [m!ct]!
Eve: Where the hell have you been?!
    Me: Oh, you know... I've been hanging around camp.
    Eve: Have you, now?
    Eve: Please, tell me more about your recreational activities.
    Me: Well, there's not all that much to tell...
    Me: I've been enjoying the summer sun, mostly.
        Eve: Care to elaborate in more detail?
                Eve: The camp IS quite beautiful... Where did you go?
                    Me: Well, first I went to the lake. Then to the girls' campground.
                        Eve: What were you doing at the girls' campground?
                                Eve: You didn't stop there for a bit?
                                    Me: I did. A patient stopped me, and we had a chat.
                                        Eve: That's nice. Which patient did you talk with?
                                    Me: Not really. I only went there to go to the lake.
                                Eve: You don't have to be so vague with me, [m!t].
                                    Me: My day wasn't all that eventful. What more can I say?
                    Me: I walked to the lake and sat there a bit, then to the gazebo.
                Eve: Just walked around? Which area?
                    Me: Around. The lake, the campground, and ended in my room.
                    Me: I went to the lake, then sat under the gazebo's shade.
        Eve: Okay...
        Eve: (What is he trying to hide?)
        Eve: [m!ct]...
        Me: Yeah?
        Eve: Why aren't you being truthful with me?
        Me: (Shit!)
        Eve: I really hope you're remaining professional with the patients.
        Me: Of course!
        Eve: Well... If you say so.
        Eve: (I'll have to keep my eye on him.)
        Narator: Eve looks down at her phone and then speaks.
        Eve: Oh. I think it's time we prepare things for the barbecue.
        Eve: Follow me.
        Eve: Ah, that makes sense.
        Me: Good... Because, usually people misunderstand me...
        Eve: *Chuckle* Maybe you should learn to enunciate, then.
        Me: Ha-ha. You all treat me like some underdeveloped troglodyte...
        Eve: Oh, come on... We just like to tease you...
        Me: And, why is that?
        Me: Easy punching bag?
        Eve: Noooo. No. It's because you've always reacted...
        Eve: *Chuckle* Even to the littlest things.
        Eve: Even that first summer you were this way.
        Me: And you've all messed with me since.
        Eve: Well, you know that's what we're here for.
        Narator: Eve looks at her phone and then speaks.
        Eve: Oh, would you look at that.
        Eve: It's time we prepare things for the barbecue!
        Eve: Please, follow me.
    Me: Well, you did tell Kiara, Emily and I to be nice to the patients.
    Me: So, I struck up a conversation with Naomi.
    Eve: I didn't mean you should become besties with them...
    Me: I'm not. But, I did think I judged her too unfairly when she arrived...
    Me: So, I decided to get to know her better.
    Eve: That is... good to hear.
    Eve: (As long as you didn't mess around with her...)
    Eve: I hope you kept the conversation within The Guidelines.
    Eve: What exactly were you doing with Naomi?
        Eve: What exactly were you doing with Naomi?
            Eve: Well, that sounds fairly ordinary.
                Eve: Well, that sounds fairly ordinary.
                    Me: It was. You think we'd mess around out in the open?
                    Eve: *Chuckle* God, no. I think you'd have to be insane to do that.
                        Eve: *Chuckle* God, no. I think you'd have to be insane to do that.
                            Eve: Are you... trying to make me suspicious?
                                Eve: Are you... trying to make me suspicious?
                                    Me: *Chuckle* No, I was just saying that some people enjoy the thrill.
                                    Me: *Chuckle* No, I was just pushing your buttons a little.
                    Me: It was. Just a nice chat, showing me that she's actually a kind girl.
            Eve: May I ask about what?
                Eve: May I ask about what?
                    Me: I just wanted to get a better picture as to who she is.
                    Eve: For what reason, exactly?
                        Eve: For what reason, exactly?
                            Me: I thought I was being too judgmental of her...
                            Me: I just wanted to get to know her better, jeez...
                    Me: Questions about her life and hobbies. Typical stuff.
                    Eve: And, why do you want to get to know her better?
                        Eve: And, why do you want to get to know her better?
                            Me: I mean, isn't it good to get to know the patients?
                            Me: Like I said... I felt I was being too judgmental of her.
        Narator: A look of nervousness and slight panic cross Eve's face.
        Eve: Some people... enjoy that?
        Eve: (He couldn't possibly...)
        Me: Yeah. Some people like to get {i}real kinky{/i}.
        Eve: That is true...
        Eve: I have treated my fair share of nymphomaniacs and chronic voyeurs.
        Me: (Eve is acting strangely...)
        Narator: Eve nervously looks down at her phone, before turning to you.
        Eve: Well, it looks like it's nearly time to prep the stuff for the barbecue.
        Eve: Please, [m!t]. Follow me.
        Eve: Ah, that all makes sense.
        Me: Good... Because, usually people misunderstand me...
        Eve: *Chuckle* Maybe you should learn to speak more clearly, then.
        Me: Ha-ha. You all treat me like some troglodyte...
        Eve: Oh, come on... We just like to tease you...
        Me: And, why is that?
        Me: Easy punching bag?
        Eve: Noooo. Of course not.
        Eve: It's because you always react so much...
        Eve: *Chuckle* Even to the littlest things.
        Eve: You've been like that since the first summer.
        Me: And you've always messed with me.
        Eve: Well, you know that's what we're here for.
        Narator: Eve looks down at her phone and then speaks.
        Eve: Oh, would you look at that.
        Eve: It's time we prepare things for the barbecue!
        Eve: Come on, follow me.
        Eve: Is that so...
        Eve: (I don't buy it...)
        Me: Yeah, that's all it was. A simple conversation.
        Eve: If you say so...
        Eve: But, to me...
        Eve: It sounds like you're not telling me everything.
        Me: (Shit!)
        Eve: I really hope you're not messing around behind my back.
        Me: Of course not!
        Eve: Well, okay then.
        Eve: (I'll have to keep my eye on him...)
        Narator: Eve looks down at her phone and then speaks.
        Eve: Oh
        Eve: It looks like it's time we prepare things for the barbecue.
        Eve: Follow me.
Narator: You walk through the back door.
Narator: At first, you don't notice anyone in the house...
Narator: However, as you look toward the couch, you notice Kiara relaxing there.
Me: (She can't go anywhere this time...)
Me: (Time to get that confession.)
Me: Hey Kiara, what's up?
Kiara: *Gasp* Hey, [m!t].
Kiara: You startled me.
Me: Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that.
Narator: You walk over to the couch, sitting down next to Kiara.
Me: How's it going, Kiara?
Kiara: Good, good...
Kiara: Just relaxing before we have to prep the barbecue stuff.
Me: Sounds nice.
Me: Mind if I join you?
Kiara: No, of course I don't mind, [m!t].
Me: Great...
Me: Hey, Kiara...
Kiara: Yes... [m!t]?
Me: Can I ask you something?
Kiara: Sure... [m!t]. What did you want to ask?
    Kiara: Sure... [m!t]. What did you want to ask?
        Me: I want to talk about what I found in your room...
        Kiara: I already told you, someone planted that stuff in my room!
            Kiara: I already told you, someone planted that stuff in my room!
                Me: I originally believed you... but, it doesn't make sense.
                Kiara: Why would I mislead you?
                    Kiara: Why would I mislead you?
                Me: I know that's not true, Kiara. Why did you do it?
        Me: I want to talk about the night I woke up in the forest...
        Kiara: I already told you, I'm not involved!
            Kiara: I already told you, I'm not involved!
                Me: Look, Kiara... I'm not angry at you... I just need answers.
                Me: Things don't just magically appear, Kiara. You know that.
                Kiara: [m!ct]... Someone is trying to frame me!
                    Kiara: [m!ct]... Someone is trying to frame me!
                        Me: I just... You really thought you needed to tie me up?
                        Kiara: I just... I thought you forgot.
                            Kiara: I just... I thought you forgot.
                                Me: Kiara, I would never forget about that moment...
                                Me: Of course not. But, tying me up wasn't right, Kiara!
                        Me: Kiara... I just want to know why you'd go that far.
    Narator: Kiara goes quiet, before tearing up.
    Kiara: I'm... so, so sorry, [m!t].
    Kiara: I don't know what came over me...
    Me: It's okay, Kiara.
    Kiara: No, it's not! I shouldn't have done that...
    Kiara: You must have been terrified...
    Kiara: ...waking up like that.
    Me: I was pretty disoriented...
    Me: And was scared at first.
    Kiara: *Sob*
    Me: But, it's okay...
    Me: I... actually enjoyed the {i}surprise.{/i}
    Narator: Kiara stops crying, a look of hopefulness appears in her eyes.
    Kiara: Really? You didn't feel violated?
    Me: Of course not. Especially now that I know it was you.
    Me: I'm just really happy to know, once and for all, who did this.
    Me: And, to know I was in especially good hands...
    Kiara: *Sniff* Thank you, [m!t].
    Narator: Kiara wipes the remaining tears off her cheeks...
    Narator: ...and you embrace her for a hug.
    Me: Let's just be more honest with each other, from now on.
    Me: So I don't end up tied to a tree, again.
    Kiara: I promise I will.
    Narator: You spend a few more moments chatting about what Kiara's been doing...
    Narator: ...before someone enters the room from the front door.
    Narator: Kiara goes quiet, before releasing a deep sigh.
    Kiara: *Sigh*
    Kiara: I have to be honest with you...
    Me: (Finally!)
    Kiara: I may have... been involved.
    Me: Involved... more directly?
    Kiara: Oh, fine...
    Kiara: I feel awful...
    Kiara: It was me.
    Me: How could you? I was terrified...
    Kiara: I know, I'm a terrible person.
    Me: ...at first.
    Kiara: Huh?
    Me: Look... You should have just been honest all along.
    Me: We should have just talked about it.
    Me: So I wouldn't end up tied to a tree.
    Kiara: My bad...
    Kiara: I just thought you'd react negatively...
    Me: You shouldn't have assumed...
    Kiara: You're right, I shouldn't have.
    Kiara: Again... I'm so sorry, [m!t].
    Me: It's okay...
    Me: I have to admit, though. I kinda {i}liked{/i} the surprise...
    Kiara: Oh?
    Me: Let's just not do that again.
    Me: (At least, not like that.)
    Kiara: I promise I won't.
    Narator: You spend a few more moments chatting about what Kiara's been doing...
    Narator: ...before someone enters the room from the front door.
Eve: Hey guys.
Eve: Enjoying your break?
Me: Yeah, I think we are.
Kiara: I'd say so, too.
Eve: That's great to hear.
Eve: Sorry to break it to you though...
Me: Time for work?
Eve: *Chuckle* Are you psychic?
Me: *Chuckle* No. I just know your catchphrases.
Eve: I need your help in the kitchen, [m!t].
Eve: Kiara, meet us there in 5 minutes, please.
Eve: Come on.
Eve: Follow me, [m!t].
Narator: Arriving in the kitchen, Eve begins informing you what needs preparing.
Eve: Until Kiara arrives, I want you to take the meat out of the fridge.
Eve: Put it on the table, on trays, please.
Me: Sure thing.
Narator: You go to the cabinet and pull out two metal trays.
Narator: Then, you go to the fridge and take out the packed meat.
Me: Should I take the meat out of the packaging?
Eve: It's not going to take itself out, is it? *Chuckles*
Me: Maybe if I ask it nicely...
Narator: You take the meat out of its packaging and place it on the tray.
Narator: Soon, Kiara arrives in the kitchen.
Kiara: Hey guys.
Eve: Perfect timing, Kiara.
Eve: [m!ct] just prepared the meat.
Eve: Let's take this out to the barbecue spot.
Eve: [m!ct], grab the bag of charcoal and the grill utensils.
Me: Sure thing.
Narator: You, Kiara and Eve arrive at the barbecue spot, near the gazebo.
Narator: Kiara and Eve place the trays down on the gazebo's table.
Eve: Have you ever worked a grill before, [m!t]?
Eve: I was thinking you could be our chef today.
Eve: If you want, of course.
Me: Sure, I'd love to!
Narator: You place the charcoal beside the grill, and the utensils on the side.
Eve: I'll go get the girls. Be right back!
Narator: As the sun begins to set, you start up the barbecue.
Me: Ah, I love the smell of hot coals.
Me: These babies are really going!
Narator: You begin seasoning the meat, and throwing them on the grill.
Narator: The sound of the meat sizzling above the hot coals is music to your ears.
Eve: Mmmm... That smells delicious.
Narator: Surprised, you look in the direction Eve's voice was coming from.
Narator: You notice Eve, followed by the girls.
Me: Hey, everyone.
Stacy: Hi, [m!t].
Stacy: Oh, a fire was started without me?
Eve: Stacy, you know you shouldn't be handling fires here...
Stacy: Such a shame...
Belle: Hey, handsome.
Narator: The girls get comfortable while the meats cook to perfection.
Narator: Soon, everyone is having a nice time enjoying each others' company.
Narator: Not long after, the food is ready.
Me: Food's done!
Me: I'll just put the cooked BBQ on the trays.
Me: You can all grab plates, and help yourselves.
Narator: [m!tc] proudly presents the trays of BBQ, and places them on the table.
Me: Enjoy!
Narator: Allowing the girls to serve themselves first, you wait patiently.
Eve: Very mature, [m!t].
Eve: I was worried you'd rush to grab some food the moment the dinner bell rang.
Me: I was raised right, I guess.
Eve: It seems you were.
Narator: Once you see the girls have taken their food, you take yours, too.
Me: Mmm. This turned out pretty good.
Belle: Yeah, this BBQ is delish!
Violet: This is amazing, [m!t]!
Narator: You all happily continue eating, and chatting.
Narator: Everyone is having a good time.
Narator: However, everyone being so preoccupied by each others' company...
Narator: ...gives Belle the perfect opportunity to sneak away.
Narator: She makes it to the main path, and begins walking toward the house.
Belle: (Just like last time...)
Belle: (If someone catches me I'll just say I needed to go to the bathroom.)
Narator: Belle enters the house stealthily, and closes the front door behind her.
Belle: (I'm in.)
Belle: (The target is upstairs.)
Narator: Belle steps softly up the stairs.
    Narator: Soon, she's on the second story landing, eyeing the doors.
    Narator: Belle tries each door, getting more excited after each attempt.
    Belle: Not that one.
    Belle: Not this one.
    Belle: Oh?
    Narator: Belle is happily surprised when the door to Eve's room opens.
    Belle: (YES!)
    Belle: (This is so exciting!)
    Narator: Carefully, Belle enters the bedroom.
    Belle: (Hmm... This room looks pretty basic.)
    Belle: (Must be Eve's room.)
    Narator: Belle immediately begins rummaging around through the room carefully.
    Narator: She first goes for the drawers of the nightstand.
    Belle: (Hmm... Nothing here).
    Belle: (Maybe the wardrobe?)
    Belle: (I wonder what goodies are in here.)
    Belle: (Eww, these clothes are so boring...)
    Belle: (Just grays, black, dark blue...)
    Belle: (Ooh, a nice red dress. Yawn.)
    Narator: Nearly giving up, Belle decides to look in a drawer inside the wardrobe.
    Belle: (Probably going to be something bori--)
    Narator: Belle is once again giddy because of what she finds.
    Belle: *Quiet gasp*
    Belle: (Wooow! Eve's got some sexy lingerie!)
    Belle: (That's what I'm talking about!)
    Belle: (If she has stuff like this...)
    Belle: (...what other goodies does she have?)
    Belle: (If I were Eve, where would I hide my favorite toys?)
    Belle: (Oh! I got it!)
    Narator: Belle quickly goes over to the bed.
    Narator: She gets on her knees, puts her arm under the bed...
    Narator: ...and feels a box.
    Belle: (This is it!)
    Narator: Belle slides the box out from under the bed...
    Narator: She opens it, revealing its contents.
    Belle: (I knew it! Eve has a kinky side!)
    Belle: (I'm sure she won't mind if I borrow this...)
    Narator: Having found the holy grail, Belle closes the box and leaves the room.
    Belle: (Hmm... I can't just bring this back with me...)
    Narator: Belle goes downstairs quickly and quietly.
    Narator: Soon, she's out the door on the front porch.
    Belle: (Maybe I can hide it in one of these bushes...)
    Belle: (It'll have to do.)
    Narator: Soon, she's on the second story landing, eyeing your bedroom door.
    Belle: (Oooh! I'm so excited!)
    Belle: (Time for round two!)
    Narator: Belle excitedly opens your door, ready for another round of looting.
    Belle: (I wonder what I'll find this time?)
    Narator: Now inside your room, Belle immediately gets to work.
    Belle: (Nothing here...)
    Belle: (Nothing over here...)
    Narator: However, as Belle begins looting through your desk drawers...
    Belle: (Hmm...)
    Belle: (Oh, what's--)
    Narator: Belle pulls something square out of the drawer.
    Belle: (OH MY GOD!)
    Belle: (XL CONDOMS?!)
    Belle: (Heh, who does he think he is?)
    Belle: *Chuckle* ({i}Ricardo?{/i})
    Narator: Belle pockets her prize gleefully.
    Narator: She gives the room a final, quick, scan...
    Narator: ...before leaving your room with her newfound treasure.
    Belle: (The girls are gonna go {i}wild{/i} when I show them this.)
    Narator: Belle goes downstairs quickly and quietly.
    Narator: Soon, she's out the door on the front porch.
    Belle: (I need to get back to the barbecue quickly...)
    Belle: (...before people start missing me.)
Narator: Back at the barbecue, the sun has mostly set.
Narator: The barbecue is wrapping up, just as Belle arrives back at the gazebo.
Me: Oh, hey, Belle. Where did you go?
Me: (Why does my gut tell me you went snooping around again?)
Belle: I had to use the ladies' room.
Me: Suuuure.
Belle: What, you want pics to prove it?
Me: What?!
Belle: Jooooking.
Me: Good... {i}good.{/i}
Belle: Did you {i}actually{/i} believe me?
Me: Psht. No way. I was just messing with {i}you.{/i}
Belle: (Sure, suuuure. I {i}totally{/i} believe you, [m!t].)
Eve: I think we'll wrap things up for tonight.
Eve: Ladies, you can spend the time before bed however you'd like.
Eve: I'd suggest a nighttime walk.
Eve: Or, you can stargaze by the lake.
Eve: There is a lot of beauty beneath the stars at this camp.
Eve: You just need to search for it, sometimes.
Eve: Have a good evening, ladies.
Narator: Hearing the good news, the girls happily head back to their campground.
Eve: [m!ct], I need you to help with clean-up.
Me: Sure. What do you need me to do?
Eve: Grab the tray and utensils we brought out earlier.
Eve: Kiara will take the trash, and Emily will take the bag of charcoal.
Eve: I'll deal with the barbecue and meet you back at the house.
Eve: See you soon.
Narator: You grab the things Eve asked you to bring back to the house.
Me: See ya.
Narator: Back in the kitchen, you spot some free space on the counter.
Me: (I'll just put these down here...)
Narator: You drop the platter on the counter.
Narator: Emily, right behind you, places the bag of charcoal down.
Narator: Kiara comes into the kitchen soon after.
Kiara: Why did I get stuck with trash duty?
Kiara: Those huge metal trash containers out on the road reek.
Kiara: And, they're so far away from the house...
Emily: We're lucky they are!
Me: Yeah, they'd make this place smell like a dump, otherwise.
Kiara: Yeah, you're right. Better that they're all the way out there.
Emily: You put the trays--
Me: Over on the counter.
Emily: Oh, they look filthy.
Me: Yeah...
Me: I really hope I don't have to do the dishes right now.
Me: It's too late at night for that.
Narator: As if answering your prayers, Eve arrives in the kitchen.
Eve: Don't worry about the dishes.
Eve: We'll do them tomorrow morning.
Me: (There {i}is{/i} justice in the world!)
Eve: I'm going to bed, it's been a long day.
Eve: You guys can hang out on the couch and watch some TV if you want.
Eve: Just make sure not to stay up too late.
Eve: Good night.
Narator: Eve leaves the kitchen, heading upstairs to go to bed.
Narator: You and the girls go to the living room, in a beeline to the couch.
Narator: Emily is the fastest, vaulting over the back of the couch to save time.
Emily: Yes! Got the best spot!
Narator: Kiara, seeing Emily take the best spot, runs to take the second-best spot.
Kiara: Sorry, [m!t]!
Narator: You're the last to get to the couch, but you don't mind the spot.
Me: It's fine. I don't mind this spot.
Me: So, what do you guys wanna watch?
Emily: Here, pass me the remote.
Narator: You pass Emily the remote, and she happily takes it off your hands.
Narator: She immediately starts flipping through the channels.
Emily: Meh.
Emily: Nope.
Emily: Oh? Nah.
Emily: Sure.
Narator: She stops on a channel playing a movie.
Narator: You all watch from an arbitrary point in the story.
Kiara: Oh, I think I've seen this one before.
Me: I don't think I have.
Kiara: You're not really missing out. It isn't that good. 
Narator: The three of you continue watching the movie.
Narator: Around two hours later, the movie is finally over.
Kiara: See? Not that good.
Me: Yeah, it was pretty boring.
Emily: So boring it made me sleepy.
Emily: I'm gonna head off to bed.
Kiara: Wait up, I will too.
Me: Oh? You're both that tired.
Kiara: It's been a long day.
Kiara: You're not sleepy?
Me: Not really. I think I'll watch TV a bit longer.
Kiara: Okay. Good night, [m!t].
Kiara: Night-night, [m!t].
Me: Night, guys.
Me: Sleep well.
Narator: You hear the girls' bedroom doors close, and pick up the remote.
Narator: Flipping through the channels, you become frustrated by the late-night programming.
Me: (What did I expect?)
Me: (There wasn't anything good on earlier.)
Me: (There's nothing good on now.)
Me: (There's never anything good on.)
Me: (Either I'm looking through rose-tinted glasses...)
Me: (...or, TV used to be better.)
Me: (I'd say the latter.)
Narator: Realizing that nothing good is on, you turn the TV off.
Me: (Eve's earlier suggestion to go on a nighttime walk sounds nice right now.)
Me: (Why not? Maybe I'll see something cool.)
Narator: You get up from your spot on the couch, eager to go on your walk.
Narator: Quickly, you're out the front door.
Me: (Ahhh. There's nothing quite like that fresh nighttime air.)
Narator: Taking a deep breath, you begin slowly walking down the path.
Me: (Nice night.)
Narator: As you continue down the path you hear some talking off in the distance.
Me: (Oh, I guess the girls are still awake.)
Me: (Might as well say hello.)
Narator: You enjoy your walk as you head over to the edge of the lake.
Narator: As you get closer, you notice them all sitting on the dock.
Me: Good evening, ladies.
Naomi: Hey, [m!t].
Violet: Hey!
Stacy: Hello, [m!t].
Belle: You just couldn't resist, huh?
Me: I wasn't tired, so I went for a walk.
Me: I heard you guys talking in the distance and decided to say hello.
Stacy: Wise choice.
Me: What have you guys been up to?
Violet: Not much. I took a short walk and came back here.
Stacy: I attempted to start a fire with a stick and rock I found...
Stacy: ...to no success.
Belle: She tried for a good 30 minutes, too.
Belle: It was pretty funny to watch.
Stacy: I was close, okay?
Belle: Suuure.
Naomi: Mostly we've just been hanging out here.
Me: That's nice. The temperature is perfect.
Naomi: It actually is.
Violet: The stars are so beautiful out here.
Violet: Without all the light pollution from civilization.
Me: Hey, you make that sound like we're in the middle of nowhere.
Violet: *Chuckle* Well, aren't we?
Me: Heh, you're right. We actually are.
Belle: Hey, everyone!
Belle: Wanna see something {i}cool?{/i}
Me: What, did you go snooping around the house again?
Belle: Hey! Spoiler!
    Narator: Belle smiles at the group with a mischievous grin.
    Belle: Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back!
    Belle: Thanks for being patient, everyone.
    Belle: I assure you it was worth the wait.
    Naomi: Oh, it {i}better{/i} be.
    Naomi: You've already set my expectations so high.
    Me: (Last time she had the key...)
    Me: (What could it--)
    Me: (OH SHIT!)
    Narator: You realize what it is Belle's talking about.
    Narator: A moment later, your worst fears are confirmed when she pulls out the box.
    Belle: I found this box of goodies.
    Violet: Oooh, what's in the box?
    Me: That could be someone's private property, Belle...
    Me: (Don't open it. Please don't open it.)
    Belle: And?
    Me: I think you should just put it back where you found it...
    Belle: Of course you do, buzzkill.
    Belle: (You're acting super sus, [m!t]...)
    Narator: As the girls' curiosity piques, Belle dramatically opens the box...
    Narator: Revealing its lewd contents to everyone.
    Naomi: Oh my god...
    Naomi: You {i}didn't.{/i}
    Me: (Fuck, I knew it.)
    Belle: Girls, take a good look at {i}Dr. Eve's little helpers.{/i}
    Violet: Belle, where did you find these?
    Me: Exactly what I was going to ask!
    Belle: Hidden under Dr. Eve's bed.
    Belle: Boomer move from Dr. Eve.
    Belle: I mean, who still hides their sex toys under the bed in a shoebox?
    Me: Belle, you can't just--
    Naomi: Sssh. [m!t], this is between us ladies.
    Belle: [m!ct], she'll never know they were gone.
    Me: Ugggh! Fine!
    Me: I don't want anything to do with this, anyway.
    Belle: You suuuure?
    Belle: Imagining Dr. Eve using these on herself doesn't turn you on?
    Me: What the hell!? 
    Me: Of course not, Belle!
    Naomi: We're not all pervs like you, Belle.
    Belle: Hey! I'm not into that... but, some people out there are.
    Me: I hope you're not insinuating that someone is {i}me...{/i}
    Belle: No, of cooooourse not, [m!t].
    Belle: Anyway...
    Belle: ...I'm more curious about something else.
    Me: Like... what?
    Belle: Liiiiiike, figuring out which one is Eve's {i}favorite.{/i}
    Narator: Belle begins rummaging through the box.
    Narator: Being as slow as possible, in choosing a toy...
    Narator: ...just to make you more uncomfortable.
    Belle: I wonder which one...
    Narator: Naomi, realizing Belle's strategy for making you uncomfortable, joins her.
    Naomi: Hmm... Knowing Eve, it's probably the anal beads.
    Naomi: Since she's so anal about everything, it just makes sense.
    Violet: *Chuckle* Naomi! That's not nice, she's just professional.
    Naomi: What's the difference?
    Belle: Ooooh, maybe it's {i}this{/i} big boy.
    Belle: I wonder what her face looks like when she takes this as deep as it can go?
    Me: *Grumble* (I gotta stop reacting, and she'll stop messing with me...)
    Me: (Easier said than done.)
    Belle: Hmm... Maybe this one?
    Narator: Belle takes out the glass toy and begins eyeing it playfully.
    Belle: Glass, huh?
    Belle: Glass does provide the {i}best view.{/i}
    Narator: Staying mentally strong, you repress the images Belle is trying to conjure in your mind.
    Narator: However, Belle eventually wears you down with her persistence.
    Belle: What do you think, [m!t]?
    Belle: Wouldn't the glass toy be the best for seeing all of Eve's beautiful pussy?
    Belle: *Giggles* Even the inside.
    Me: *Gulp* No comment. This is too fuckin' weird...
    Violet: Belle, ease off [m!t] a bit.
    Naomi: Why should she do that?
    Stacy: Because [m!t] does not look pleased...
    Stacy: ...and he might leave.
    Me: Exactly! I can walk away whenever I like...
    Belle: Awww... Come on, [m!t].
    Belle: You don't need to do that...
    Belle: I didn't mean anything by it.
    Me: Yeah, I know.
    Me: You just like how I look when I'm uncomfortable.
    Me: Most of you here have told me that at least once, by now.
    Naomi: *Giggle* Well, maybe it's because the faces you make when you're uncomfortable...
    Naomi: ...are super cute.
    Me: Look, I just wanted to relax...
    Me: This is {i}not{/i} relaxing.
    Belle: Alright, alright... I'll put them away.
    Narator: Belle puts the toys she had out back in the box, and closes the lid.
    Belle: Relaxed now?
    Me: I'm a little better, now.
    Belle: *Chuckle* What, the box itself causes you pain?
    Me: No, I'm fine.
    Me: (I'd love to chuck the contents of the box into the lake, right now.)
    Me: (But that's a worse idea than stealing it in the first place...)
    Me: (What the hell was Belle thinking?!)
    Me: (This could get everyone in trouble...)
    Me: (I'll have to convince Belle to put it back, soon.)
    Violet: It really is nice out here.
    Stacy: Yes, it's a beautiful night.
    Narator: Belle smiles at the group with a mischievous grin.
    Belle: Everyone, close your eyes.
    Belle: Jussst a second.
    Belle: I assure you it'll be worth the wait.
    Naomi: Oh, it better be.
    Naomi: You've already set my expectations so high.
    Me: (Last time she had my underwear...)
    Me: (I wonder what she stole from my room this time.)
    Belle: Okay. Open your eyes!
    Narator: As you and the girls open your eyes, Belle bursts out laughing.
    Belle: Waahahah! A giant condom!
    Belle: For a {i}monster{/i} dong!
    Violet: *Chuckle* You're crazy, Belle!
    Stacy: Indeed you are, Belle.
    Me: Belle! Where did you get that?!
    Belle: I got it from your room. Where else?
    Belle: But, really? I'm sure you're big, [m!t], but not {i}magnum{/i} big...
    Me: Hey!
    Naomi: Sssh. [m!ct], this is between us ladies.
    Me: Psht. Fine!
    Me: Like I care you stole that, anyway...
    Belle: {i}Sure you don't.{/i}
    Narator: Belle holds the condom packaging in front of her face with both hands.
    Narator: The girls watch on, as Belle rips the package open...
    Narator: Pulling out the rolled-up magnum condom.
    Me: Oh come on, I was going to use that...
    Naomi: Were you, now?
    Belle: I thought you weren't allowed to do those kinds of things with us, [m!t].
    Me: I didn't mean at Red Falls!
    Belle: Aww, now I'm disappointed.
    Belle: I would have liked to see you wearing this...
    Belle: *Whisper* ...but without it will be fine, too.
    Belle: Whatever. Since you're not going to use it, we will!
    Narator: Belle unrolls the condom.
    Narator: She begins shaking the long, dangly condom in front of her face.
    Belle: *Giggle* Aww, it's so floppy.
    Narator: Next, she stretches it between her hands.
    Belle: Boinga-boinga-boing. It's so stretchy!
    Narator: However, Naomi could never expect what Belle would do next.
    Belle: Hey, Naomi!
    Narator: Naomi turns to Belle, and is greeted by the loose condom slapping her cheek.
    Violet: *Gasp* Ahahaha!
    Stacy: Belle, how unexpected!
    Me: (I'm sure Naomi is gonna kill her, now.)
    Naomi: WHAT THE HELL?!
    Naomi: What's wrong with you, slut!?
    Belle: Why are you angry, Naomi?
    Belle: I thought you like stuff like this.
    Narator: Naomi jumps toward Belle, but is luckily caught by Violet.
    Violet: Naomi, calm down. It was just a stupid joke.
    Naomi: Let go of me! I'll kill her!
    Me: Come on, girls, calm down.
    Me: Let's just forget about the rubber and have a good night.
    Violet: Yeah, let's all just chill.
    Naomi: That's easy for you to say, {i}fatty.{/i}
    Violet: Ahahah, good one. Naomi, you just gotta learn to live a little. 
    Me: (Why is Violet acting so relaxed?)
    Me: (She's usually pretty shy.)
Narator: The girls, now over their giddiness, calm down and watch the stars.
Narator: You sit there with the girls, watching silently.
Narator: You all take in the night's aura of serenity.
Narator: For a moment everyone forgets their troubles, living only in that moment.
Narator: You and the girls pass the time counting shooting stars.
Stacy: Ooh, another fire-tailed star!
Violet: I think that's the fifth shooting star I've seen in the past half hour.
Me: It's truly magical out here, huh?
Stacy: Mystical...
Narator: More time passes until Naomi speaks up to announce her departure.
Naomi: It's been nice, but I'm heading off to bed.
Me: Oh, you're tired?
Naomi: Yeah, I am. Remember that yard work I did earlier?
Me: How could I forget?
Me: (I did half of it.)
Naomi: Yeah, well, I'm exhausted.
Stacy: I, too, hear the Sandman calling to me.
Me: Ah, well. It was a pleasure, ladies.
Naomi: Good night everyone.
Stacy: Night girls. Night [m!t].
Me: See you two tomorrow. Good night.
Narator: After looking at the stars a moment longer, Violet stands up.
Violet: Hey guys, I think I'm going to take a walk before sleep.
Violet: It's so nice out, tonight.
Violet: And, I still have too much pent-up energy I want to release.
Me: That's a good idea. I'm sure you'll have a nice time.
Me: Just watch out for Hector.
Belle: *Giggle* I'm sure she could take him.
Violet: Heh. I probably could.
Me: *Chuckle* I {i}could{/i} imagine you taking him down.
Violet: Well, anyway...
Violet: I think I'm going to take that walk now.
Violet: I might go to that campfire spot we were at the first night, then back.
Me: (Why is she being so detailed?)
Me: (Was that a subtle invitation?)
Belle: Sounds great. Don't have too much fun out there...
Belle: ...{i}without me.{/i}
Violet: *Chuckle* Okay, Belle, I won't.
Violet: I'll make sure to have a miserable time.
Violet: Night, [m!t].
Me: Good night, Violet.
Belle: See ya in the morning, V!
Narator: Violet leaves the dock.
Narator: But, as she gets a little farther away... 
Narator: ...Violet looks back toward you one last time.
Me: (What was that look? It looked like she was telling me something...)
Me: (It seemed like she was making sure I understood the first invite.)
Belle: So...
Belle: Looks like we're the only ones left.
Belle: Which means I have you all to myself.
Me: And what ideas do you have in your head, now?
Me: (I think I know what to expect...)
Belle: I thiiiink...
Belle: We could go on a little walk, together.
Me: Oh? Just a walk?
Belle: Who knows what exciting things might happen unexpectedly?
Belle: I just know you'll have a good time with me.
Me: Oh, straight to the point?
Belle: What? Nooo. I was just saying you love my company.
Me: Suuuure. I believe you.
Me: (Hmm...)
Me: (Should I go with Belle, or go find Violet?)
Me: (Both of them seemed eager to hang out with me more...)
    Me: (But, I could also stop by Stacy's cabin to say hello.)
    Me: (I'm sure it would make her happy.)
Me: (Heading to bed is always an option, as well.)
Belle: Well? What are you waiting for?
    Belle: Well? What are you waiting for?
        Me: Nothing. Let's go on that walk.
        Belle: You made the right choice coming with me, [m!t]...
        Belle: You'll see.
        Belle: Just follow me.
        Narator: Belle leads you away from the dock, but follows the lake's shoreline.
        Me: Where are we going?
        Belle: You really wanna know? But, that would kill the surprise...
        Me: Don't tell me, then.
        Belle: Good choice.
        Narator: You both continue walking along the lake's shore in near-silence.
        Narator: Occasionally, you make a comment about the scenery.
        Me: It's so peaceful at this time of night.
        Me: I barely hear any crickets chirping anymore.
        Belle: Sshh... Keep following me.
        Narator: You and Belle continue walking along the lake's shore...
        Narator: Until you realize that you've both come full-circle.
        Me: Wait... We're back at the dock.
        Belle: *Giggle* Yep.
        Me: Is this another prank?
        Belle: Not exactly...
                Narator: Did Belle find Eve's toys box?
        Narator: Suddenly, Belle pulls you by the arm toward the changing booth.
        Belle: Over here...
        Narator: Now inside the semi-enclosed changing booth...
        Narator: Belle begins touching you all over your body.
        Me: Straight to it, huh?
        Belle: Oh, I think you've made me wait long enough.
        Belle: I know some of the other girls have already had their fun with you...
        Belle: Now, it's finally my turn.
        Narator: Belle takes your shirt off sensually, but quickly.
        Belle: You wont need that...
        Me: (She's {i}really{/i} eager, huh?)
        Belle: ...or {i}these.{/i}
        Narator: In an erotic frenzy, Belle pulls your pants down.
        Me: Woah! You almost tripped me!
        Belle: Oops, sorry!
        Belle: I think you're going to like this.
        Me: Am I?
        Belle: I think you will.
        Me: I guess you'll have to try your best.
        Belle: Will I?
        Belle: (You're going to explode in 3 seconds.)
        Narator: Belle, now ogling your mostly-nude body, begins playing with her breasts.
        Belle: Aren't you going to help {i}me?{/i}
        Narator: Taking Belle's hint, you start taking off her clothes.
        Narator: Starting with her top...
        Belle: Ooh...
        Narator: Followed by her skirt...
        Me: I don't think you need this, either.
        Belle: Somebody's eager...
        Narator: As her clothes fall to the ground, you can't help but look at her sexy body.
        Belle: Couldn't help it?
        Belle: Neither can I.
        Narator: Belle touches your crotch, and begins rubbing your cock...
        Belle: These are in the way.
        Narator: Belle stops rubbing your now-throbbing cock, to pull down your underwear.
        Belle: That's it... {i}Let me see it.{/i}
        Narator: Belle kneels down, her face right in front of your eager member.
        Belle: You have a nice cock, [m!t].
        Belle: It deserves an award...
        Narator: Belle's tongue extends out of her mouth, and flicks your tip.
        Me: AAAhhh...
        Belle: Feel gooood?
        Me: Yeah, a little too good.
        Belle: Oh, just you wait...
        Narator: Belle brings her mouth closer to your cock...
        Belle: You're not ready for this.
        Narator: Her tongue begins licking up and down your shaft.
        Me: Yeah... Mmm...
        Narator: Hearing your pleasure, Belle licks more vigorously.
        Belle: (You'll {i}love{/i} what's coming.)
        Narator: Suddenly, her mouth takes your entire tip in, and she begins sucking it.
        Belle: MMmph. Ah!
        Narator: Belle sucks and releases your tip repeatedly, in a popping motion.
        Belle: Like this?
        Me: Fuck... Yeah...
        Belle: How about this, then?
        Narator: You're hit by a rush of pleasure as Belle takes your cock into her mouth.
        Me: Ooooh shiiit...
        Belle: (I'll melt your fucking brain.)
        Belle: (You'll crave me, [m!t]...)
        Belle: (Like they {i}all{/i} do.)
        Narator: Belle sucks your cock faster, and harder.
        Narator: You feel her tongue wrap around your cock, as she slides you deeper.
        Belle: *Gasp* You like this?
        Belle: I do too...
        Narator: Belle thrusts your cock deep into her throat...
        Narator: And, as she does, you notice one of her hands is no longer touching you.
        Narator: Her hand is rubbing her soaking-wet pussy.
        Me: (Damn, Belle is also really enjoying this...)
        Me: (She's soaking wet.)
        Narator: You pull Belle's head off your shaft as a thought comes to mind.
        Me: How about we take this a little further?
        Belle: {i}Good idea.{/i}
        Belle: Stick it in, [m!t].
        Me: You want it that badly?
        Belle: YES! Fucking give it to me, already!
        Me: Well, if you insist...
        Belle: Come ooooon, stop teasing me...
        Me: You don't think I'm being fair?
        Belle: Huh? What the hell are you talking about?
        Me: Well, after all those times you teased me...
        Me: I'd say this is only fair.
        Belle: *Groans* Fine...
        Me: Damn, Belle... You're even wetter than earlier.
        Belle: {i}I am...{/i}
            Belle: How about...
            Belle: ...I use some of these?
            Me: Wait, wait, wait...
            Me: You really want to use those?
            Belle: Did I stutter?
            Me: (I shouldn't let her use those...)
            Me: (But, I {i}would{/i} love to see how deep inside she could take these.)
            Belle: I'll clean them up before I return them...
            Belle: [m!ct], Eve will never find out. I promise.
                Belle: [m!ct], Eve will never find out. I promise.
                    Me: Fine.
                    Me: Since you want me to use these on you so badly...
                    Me: ...I will.
                    Belle: You made the right choice, [m!t].
                    Belle: Take your pick...
                    Belle: That tiny thing?
                    Belle: Better than nothing, I guess...
                    Belle: Shove it into my cute little pussy.
                    Belle: Right there...
                    Me: Like this?
                    Belle: Aww... Just the tip?
                    Belle: I want more.
                    Belle: OOOoohh... Yeah...
                    Me: Too much?
                    Belle: No... no...
                    Belle: That feels {i}much{/i} nicer.
                    Me: How about we try a different toy?
                    Belle: Sounds good to me...

                    Belle: Shove that huge thing into my cute little pussy.
                    Belle: Right there...

                Belle: Mhm... It reaches all the right places.
                Belle: Stick it in my pussy, [m!t].
                Belle: Right there...
                Me: Like this?
                Belle: OOOooh... Shiiit...
                Belle: It's bigger than I expected.
                Belle: But...
                Belle: I want {i}more.{/i}
                Belle: OOOoohh... Fuuuck yeeeah...
                Me: Too much?
                Belle: No... no...
                Belle: I've been craving this feeling since I got here.
                Belle: But, it's not nearly enough...
                Belle: [m!ct], I want you to join in.
                Me: Oh, yeah?
                Belle: Yeah. Stick your huge cock into my ass.
                Me: You like this?
                Belle: I doooo...
                Belle: Mmm... Yes...
                Me: You're so wet, Belle...
                Belle: I can't help it...
                Belle: This is really exciting.
                Belle: But, it would be even better if you stuck it in already.
                Me: OOooh, fuck!
                Belle: Surprise ya?
                Me: A little...
                Belle: *Giggle* I'm... gonna surprise you {i}even more.{/i}
                Me: Mmmff... Fuck, Belle...
                Belle: Is it good?
                Me: It's... fucking amazing...
                Belle: Mmm...
                Belle: Oooohh...
                Belle: Agreed...
                Me: Surprise!
                Belle: *Moan* Fuuuuck, yeeeah...
                Belle: I'm gonna...
                Belle: Ahhh...
                Belle: I'm gonna cum!
                Me: Me too...
                Belle: Do it.
                Belle: Cum inside me...
                Belle: Fill me with your hot load, [m!t]!
                Me: If you insist.
                    Me: If you insist.
                        Belle: Mmmmfff... AAAH!
                        Me: *Moan* Oooh... Fuuuuck!
                        Belle: Oh, yeah...
                        Belle: I feel so warm inside...
                        Belle: Mmm... It's nice.
                        Belle: Aww... Leaving so soon?
                        Me: It can't last forever, Belle.
                        Belle: Next time we should do this without that.
                        Me: Maybe... If we can find the time.
                        Me: So...
                        Me: How was it?
                        Belle: It was pretty good.
                        Me: Pfft...
                        Belle: Hey, now...
                        Belle: I didn't say it wasn't {i}the best.{/i}
                        Me: You really think this was the best?
                        Belle: Well, maybe not {i}the best...{/i} but, definitely {i}one of{/i} the best.
                        Me: Heh. I'll take it.
                        Belle: Good... You should be proud.
                        Belle: {i}You satisfied me.{/i}
                        Belle: *Yawn* And, exhausted me.
                        Me: *Yawn* I wonder what time it is.
                        Belle: It's late, for sure.
                        Belle: I'd say it's time for bed.
                        Me: Yeah, we really got the blood pumping.
                        Belle: *Giggle* I'm sure Violet would be happy we got our exercise for the day.
                        Me: *Chuckle* Yeah, right.
                        Belle: Thanks for everything, [m!t].
                        Belle: I'm gonna go get my beauty sleep, now.
                        Me: Okay...
                        Belle: *Giggle* Just messing with you.
                        Belle: Night, [m!t].
                        Me: Night, Belle.
                        Belle: Mmmmfff... AAAH!
                        Me: *Moan* Oooh... Fuuuuck!
                        Belle: Oh, yeah...
                        Belle: That felt fucking {i}amaaaazing...{/i}
                        Me: Then you're gonna love {i}this.{/i}
                        Belle: WHAT THE FUCK?!
                        Belle: Naughty boy!
                        Belle: Maybe next time we can do this somehow more interesting.
                        Me: Hmm... {i}Maybe.{/i}
                        Me: So...
                        Me: How was it?
                        Belle: It was pretty good.
                        Me: Pfft...
                        Belle: Hey, now...
                        Belle: I didn't say it wasn't {i}the best.{/i}
                        Me: You really think this was the best?
                        Belle: Well, maybe not {i}the best...{/i} but, definitely {i}one of{/i} the best.
                        Me: Heh. I'll take it.
                        Belle: Good... You should be proud.
                        Belle: {i}You satisfied me.{/i}
                        Belle: *Yawn* And, exhausted me.
                        Me: *Yawn* I wonder what time it is.
                        Belle: It's late, for sure.

                        Me: *Chuckle* Yeah, right.
                        Belle: Thanks for everything, [m!t].
                        Belle: I'm gonna go get my beauty sleep, now.
                        Me: Okay...
                        Belle: *Giggle* Just messing with you.
                        Belle: Night, [m!t].
                        Me: Night, Belle.
                Me: Sorry, Belle...
                Me: But, I'd rather be the only thing you feel.
                Belle: Well, that's kinda lame.
                Me: You really need a toy to satisfy you?
                Me: Even when you have the real thing?
                Belle: No... I guess I don't.
                Belle: I just thought it would be more fun.
                Belle: But, I think that huge thing will be fun enough.
                Me: Oh, will it?
                Belle: Yeah, {i}it will.{/i}
                Belle: If it doesn't, I'll be shocked...
                Belle: ...and, maybe even disappointed.
                Me: We wouldn't want that, now.
                Belle: Oooh! Yesss...
                Me: You like this?
                Belle: I doooo...
                Belle: Mmm... Yes...
                Me: You're so wet, Belle...
                Belle: I can't help it...
                Belle: This is really exciting.
                Belle: But, it would be even better if you stuck it in already.
                Me: OOooh, fuck!
                Belle: Surprise ya?
                Me: A little...
                Belle: *Giggle* I'm... gonna surprise you {i}even more.{/i}
                Me: Mmmff... Fuck, Belle...
                Belle: Is it good?
                Me: It's... fucking amazing...
                Belle: Mmm...
                Belle: Oooohh...
                Belle: Agreed...
                Me: Surprise!
                Belle: *Moan* Fuuuuck, yeeeah...
                Belle: I'm gonna...
                Belle: Ahhh...
                Belle: I'm gonna cum!
                Me: Me too...
                Belle: Do it.
                Belle: Cum inside me...
                Belle: Fill me with your hot load, [m!t]!
                Me: If you insist.
                Belle: Mmmmfff... AAAH!
                Me: *Moan* Oooh... Fuuuuck!
                Belle: Oh, yeah...
                Belle: I feel so warm inside...
                Belle: Mmm... It's nice.
                Me: It can't last forever, Belle.
                Belle: Aww... Leaving so soon?
                Me: Yeah, I need to take this thing off.
                Belle: Next time we should do this without that.
                Me: Maybe.
                Me: So...
                Me: How was it?
                Belle: It was pretty good.
                Me: Pfft...
                Belle: Hey, now...
                Belle: I didn't say it wasn't {i}the best.{/i}
                Me: You really think this was the best?
                Belle: Well, maybe not {i}the best...{/i} but, definitely {i}one of{/i} the best.
                Me: Heh. I'll take it.

                Me: Okay...
                Belle: *Giggle* Just messing with you.
                Belle: Night, [m!t].
                Me: Night, Belle.
        Me: I think I'm gonna go back to the house.
        Me: I'm pretty tired.
        Belle: Aww, how disappointing.
        Belle: Hopefully you'll have the energy to stay up longer, tomorrow.
        Me: We'll see.
        Me: See you tomorrow, Belle.
        Me: Night.
        Belle: Night, sexy.
        Narator: You walk away from Belle, now focused on finding Violet.
        Me: (Where did she say she was going?)
        Me: (The campfire spot from the first night?)
        Me: (Yeah, I think that's what she said.)
        Narator: Walking beneath the blanket of stars above Red Falls...
        Narator: You make it to the spot Violet spoke of.
        Me: (I wonder where she is?)
        Me: (Oh, is that--)
        Violet: Hey, [m!t].
        Violet: So... You decided to join me after all?
        Me: I wanted to spend more of this beautiful night with a beautiful girl.
        Violet: Do... Do you mean that?
        Me: Yeah, I do.
        Me: You're gorgeous, and kind.
        Me: (And, your body is a perfect 10/10.)
            Violet: Oh, [m!t]...
            Violet: I've wanted to hear you say that for so long.
            Me: You have?
            Violet: I was so shy when I first got here...
            Violet: But, now I feel much more comfortable.
            Me: It makes me happy to hear that, Violet...
            Me: I'm glad you feel comfortable with me.
            Me: I feel close to you too.
            Violet: You do?
            Me: How couldn't I?
            Me: You're kind, fun to exercise with, and irresistible.
            Violet: Irresistible?
            Me: Yeah.
            Violet: Oh, [m!t]...
            Me: Violet...
            Violet: I've wanted you to do that for so long, [m!t]...
            Me: You have?
            Violet: I have. I was just so shy before...
            Me: It's okay, Violet.
            Violet: To be honest...
            Violet: ...I want to do other things to you too.
            Me: Wow. Okay. I didn't expect you to say that so openly.
            Violet: Oh, did I frighten you?
            Me: No, no. I'm just surprised... It was unexpected.
            Violet: Well... I'm finally starting to feel comfortable.
            Violet: I can't help it if I'm feeling the urge to be more honest...
            Violet: Especially with you.
            Me: No, Violet...
            Me: I like this side of you.
            Me: I'm glad you feel more comfortable with me, already.
            Violet: You are?
            Me: Yeah, really glad...
            Violet: Oh, [m!t]...
            Violet: Come here.
            Me: You're wonderful, Violet.
            Violet: So are you, [m!t]...
            Me: Mmm...
            Violet: Does that feel good?
            Me: Yeah, it does.
            Violet: Oh!
            Me: Sorry! Too fast?
            Violet: Don't be sorry. And, no... I was just surprised.
            Violet: And, your touch...
            Me: Excited you like you excited me?
            Violet: Oh...
            Violet: {i}Yes.{/i}
            Me: Someone's eager.
            Violet: I can't help it... I want to see your body.
            Me: Will you be joining me?
            Violet: Well, yes...
            Violet: Help a girl out?
            Me: This better?
            Violet: Much better...
            Violet: Do you like this?
            Violet: And, this?
            Me: Yeah, Violet.
            Me: You're... doing something to me.
            Violet: Oh, it looks like I am.
            Violet: Let me help you with that huge thing...
            Me: Ohhh...
            Violet: *Moan* Oh, yeah... [m!t]...
            Violet: Touch me...
            Violet: Touch me!
            Me: *Moan* Oh, Violet...
            Violet: [m!ct]...
            Violet: I'm... close.
            Me: Me too...
            Violet: Cum, [m!t]. Cum for me.
            Me: You too, then.
            Violet: Mmmff... I... will.
            Violet: AAH! Yes!
            Me: Fuuuck, yeah...
            Violet: That... was a good exercise.
            Violet: Don't you think so, my special workout partner?
            Me: I do, Violet. You're a great special workout partner.
            Violet: I'm glad you think so...
            Violet: Maybe we can do some special yoga sometime?
            Me: Hopefully sooner than later.
            Violet: I'm glad you followed, [m!t].
            Me: I am too... I had a great time out here with you.
            Violet: Good night, [m!t].
            Violet: Sleep well, okay?
            Me: I will. You too, Violet.
            Violet: I have a feeling I'll sleep wonderfully, tonight.
            Me: Me too.
            Me: Good night, Violet.
                Me: Hmm...
                Me: (Violet seemed... different.)
                Me: (Really different, actually.)
                Me: (She was so shy before today.)
                Me: (I wonder if this has anything to do with her session, earlier.)
                Me: (She's been pretty relaxed since then.)
                Me: *Chuckle* (Eve's really doing something amazing here.)
                Me: Hmm...
                Me: (Violet seemed... different.)
                Me: (Really different, actually.)
                Me: (She was so shy before today.)
                Me: (I guess she's getting comfortable, finally.)
                Me: (It's nice to see her out of her shell...)
            Violet: You really mean that?
            Violet: You're not messing with me?
            Me: No! Why would I be that cruel?
            Violet: I don't think you would...
            Me: What? Do you think someone put me up to this?
            Violet: No, of course not.
            Violet: It just... came out of the blue so suddenly.
            Me: I've felt it for a while, Violet...
            Violet: You have?
            Me: Yeah. How could anyone not like you?
            Me: And, how could anyone resist?
            Violet: [m!ct], you're so sweet...
            Me: So are you, Violet...
            Me: Compared to most of the girls here, you're the sweetest.
            Violet: Oh, [m!t]...
            Me: *Quietly* You have beautiful eyes.
            Violet: So do you...
            Me: Mm... Woah.
            Violet: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?
            Me: Yeah, you did... But, it's okay.
            Me: It was the best kind of surprise...
            Violet: I'm gla--
            Violet: Oh, [m!t]...
            Violet: Hold me.
            Violet: Mmmm...
            Violet: I've wanted this for so long...
            Me: You have?
            Violet: Yeah, I just felt too shy before.
            Me: I'm glad you feel comfortable with me, Violet.
            Violet: I'm glad you followed, [m!t].
            Me: I am too... I had a great time out here with you.
            Violet: Good night, [m!t].
            Violet: Sleep well, okay?
            Me: I will. You too, Violet.
            Violet: I have a feeling I'll sleep wonderfully, tonight.
            Me: Me too.
            Me: Good night, Violet.
        Me: I think I'm gonna go back to the house.
        Me: I'm pretty tired.
        Belle: Aww, how disappointing.
        Belle: Hopefully you'll have the energy to stay up longer, tomorrow.
        Me: We'll see.
        Me: (Especially since I'm not going to sleep...)
        Me: (...or back to the house.)
        Me: See you tomorrow, Belle.
        Me: Night.
        Belle: Night, sexy.
        Narator: You walk away from Belle, now focused on quickly getting to Stacy's cabin.
        Me: (I don't have much time, Belle will be right behind me...)
        Me: (Gotta make this quick.)
        Narator: Every so often you make sure Belle isn't following you.
        Me: (I don't think she followed me.)
        Narator: Now at the door of Stacy and Belle's cabin, you gently knock.
        Stacy: Who's there?
        Me: It's just me, Stacy.
        Stacy: Oh, how wonderful. Hello, [m!t].
        Stacy: Why are you gracing me with your presence?
        Me: Well, I just wanted to say good night to you before I went to bed.
        Stacy: How sweet...
            Me: Where are we going?
            Stacy: I didn't want Belle to interrupt us.
            Stacy: So... You must feel the bonding flames, too.
            Me: The what?
            Stacy: You feel the same passion for me, as I do for you.
            Me: I do, Stacy...
            Me: I think we've gotten really close.
            Stacy: As do I.
            Narator: Before you can say a word, she kisses you passionately on the lips.
            Stacy: Ah... My heart is ablaze.
            Stacy: I want you, I need you...
            Stacy: Your hot, divine, rod.
            Me: Well...
            Me: I think I know where we can go.
            Me: Follow me, Stacy.
            Narator: Under the cover of darkness, you and Stacy made it to the deck undetected.
            Me: Nobody comes out here this late at night.
            Stacy: Then... we can continue.
            Stacy: Sit down, please.
            Stacy: Good...
            Me: Hmm?
            Stacy: I want to make you feel the divine flames rage.
            Stacy: Give me your passion, [m!t].
            Me: Okay, Stacy...
            Me: I will.
            Stacy: Mmm... Yes...
            Stacy: But, it would be easier if...
            Narator: Taking Stacy's cue, you help her take her shirt off.
            Stacy: Yes, [m!t]... I am yours...
            Me: You are?
            Stacy: Tonight, I am here to satisfy your desires.
            Stacy: Let me help you with these...
            Stacy: As expected... You crave my warmth, too.
            Me: I can't hide it.
            Stacy: Yes. It is far too big...
            Stacy: ...but not for me.
            Me: Oh, yeah, Stacy...
            Stacy: You enjoy this?
            Me: Yeah...
            Stacy: Tell me what to do, and I'll follow your command.
            Me: You really know how to make a man happy, don't you?
            Stacy: What can I say? I am a scholar among my people.
            Stacy: So, what do you desire, my prince?
            Me: How about... a handjob?
            Stacy: Anything for you, [m!t]...
            Me: Oh yeah...
            Stacy: Do you like this?
            Me: You really know what you're doing.
            Stacy: I am glad you like my technique...
            Stacy: It is one of the highest forms of erotic art within our dogma.
            Me: Mmmff... Is it?
            Stacy: Yes.
            Me: Your religion sounds better... and better... every day.
            Stacy: Well, this should feel even better, then.
            Stacy: Is this good?
            Me: Ooooh, yeah...
            Stacy: Do you feel my warmth?
            Me: Mhm... Keep going...
            Stacy: Focus on the hot pleasure...
            Me: Aaah...
            Me: Can we try something else?
            Stacy: As you wish, my prince.
            Me: Can we try something else?
            Stacy: As you wish, my prince.
            Me: A blowjob would be great...
            Stacy: Anything for you, [m!t]...
            Me: Oh yeah...
            Stacy: Do you like this?
            Me: You really know what you're doing.
            Stacy: I am glad you like my technique, so far...
            Stacy: I think you'll love this.
            Stacy: It is one of the erotic arts within our dogma.
            Me: Mmmff... Is it?
            Stacy: *Gasp* Ah! Yes.
            Me: Your religion sounds better... and better... every day.
            Stacy: Well, this should feel even better, then.
            Me: You're so good, Stacy...
            Me: Aahhh...
            Me: Yeah, yeah...
            Me: This is great...
            Me: Oooh... fuuu--
            Me: This is amazing...
            Me: Can we try something else?
            Stacy: As you wish, my prince.
            Me: Can we try something else?
            Stacy: As you wish, my prince.
            Me: I'd love a titjob, Stacy.
            Stacy: Anything for you, [m!t]...
            Me: Mmm... They're so soft...
            Stacy: Do you like this?
            Me: it feels amazing, Stacy...
            Stacy: I am glad you like it.
            Stacy: I know they're not the biggest...
            Stacy: But, I think my technique will compensate.
            Stacy: It is one of the highest forms of erotic art within our dogma.
            Me: Stacy, your tits are amazing...
            Stacy: You really think so?
            Me: Yes. They're perfect...
            Stacy: It warms my bosom to hear that, [m!t]...
            Stacy: I'm going to make you feel even better, now.
            Stacy: Do you like how they feel?
            Me: Yeah, they're so soft...
            Stacy: Feel the heat of my soul...
            Me: Mmm... Fuuuu...
            Stacy: I'm going as fast as I can...
            Me: It feels amazing, Stacy...
            Me: Can we try something else?
            Stacy: As you wish, my prince.
            Me: Can we try something else?
            Stacy: As you wish, my prince.
            Me: I can't hold it much longer...
            Me: I'm gonna...
            Me: I'm gonna cum, Stacy.
            Stacy: Give it to me, [m!t].
            Stacy: Give it to me here...
            Me: If you insist...
            Stacy: I want it all.
            Me: *Moan* Oooohh... Aahhh...
            Stacy: Mmmff... Aah!
            Stacy: There's so much, [m!t]...
            Me: Sorr--
            Stacy: No, [m!t], that was a positive statement...
            Me: Oh... Okay.
            Me: You never cease to amaze me, Stacy...
            Stacy: Good... You amaze me too, my prince.
            Me: Every day I get closer and closer to joining your religion, Stacy.
            Stacy: *Giggle* Then my mission as an envoy is going according to plan...
            Me: Heh... I really hope you're joking...
            Stacy: An envoy of the divine flame never reveals her secrets.
            Stacy: However...
            Stacy: I think I should return to my cabin, now. It's quite late.
            Stacy: Thank you, again, for coming to see me.
            Me: Anytime, Stacy. I'm glad I did, too.
            Stacy: Good night, ashen prince.
            Me: Good night, beautiful.
            Me: I can't hold it much longer...
            Me: I'm gonna...
            Me: I'm gonna cum, Stacy.
            Stacy: Give it to me, [m!t].
            Stacy: Cover my breasts in your hot passion...
            Me: If you insist...
            Stacy: I want it all.
            Me: *Moan* Oooohh... Aahhh...
            Stacy: Oh! Yes...
            Stacy: There's so much, [m!t]...
            Stacy: And, some of it went so far...
            Me: Sorr--
            Stacy: No, [m!t], it's fine.
            Me: Oh... Okay.
            Me: You never cease to amaze me, Stacy...
            Stacy: Good... You amaze me too, my prince.
            Me: Every day I get closer and closer to joining your religion, Stacy.
            Stacy: *Giggle* Then my mission as an envoy is going according to plan...
            Me: Heh... I really hope you're joking...
            Stacy: An envoy of the divine flame never reveals her secrets.
            Stacy: However...
            Stacy: I think I should return to my cabin, now. It's quite late.
            Stacy: Thank you, again, for coming to see me.
            Me: Anytime, Stacy. I'm glad I did, too.
            Stacy: Good night, ashen prince.
            Me: Good night, beautiful.
            Stacy: Won't you come in?
            Me: Sure. I didn't know I was welcome.
            Stacy: You're always welcome in my domain, [m!t].
            Narator: Having been invited in by Stacy, you enter the cabin.
            Stacy: Come here, please...
            Stacy: Hello, [m!t].
            Stacy: What did I do to get in the good graces of the divine flame?
            Me: You must have paid good tribute...
            Stacy: Indeed...
            Narator: Before you can say a word, she kisses you passionately on the lips.
            Stacy: Thank you for coming to say good night, [m!t].
            Me: No problem, I'm glad I did...
            Stacy: Belle will arrive back here, soon...
            Stacy: I wish we had more time.
            Me: I also do.
            Stacy: Another time, I suppose. Good night, [m!t].
            Me: Good night, Stacy. Sleep well.
            Narator: You linger a moment longer, looking into Stacy's longing eyes.
            Me: (What is that look? How badly does she want me?)
            Me: (Those eyes are going to stick with me.)
        Me: I think I'm gonna go back to the house.
        Me: I'm pretty tired.
        Belle: Aww, how disappointing.
        Belle: Hopefully you'll have the energy to stay up longer, tomorrow.
        Me: We'll see.
        Me: That all depends on Eve.
        Belle: Yeah, it does.
        Belle: And, I'm aware she's Mrs. Boring.
        Me: *Chuckle* She can be, at times.
        Me: Night, Belle.
        Belle: Night, sexy.
        Narator: You walk away from Belle, and head back to the house.
        Belle: (I'll make you my simp, [m!t].)
        Belle: {i}(You'll see...){/i}
        Narator: Arriving in your room, you feel more tired than earlier.
        Narator: However, you still feel slightly restless...
        Narator: Mostly because of the girls' behavior on the dock.
        Me: (The girls really know how to make me horny...)
        Me: (Meh. Whatever...)
        Narator: Sitting on your bed, you scroll through your phone.
            Narator: You browse the internet a bit, eventually getting bored.
            Narator: However, before putting your phone down... 
            Narator: You see an old message from Kiara.
            Me: (Oh. Kiara...)
            Me: (\"The dreaded Forest Sucker.\")
            Me: *Chuckles*
            Narator: As you stop chuckling to yourself, you feel a strange urge...
            Me: (Should I reach out to her?)
            Me: (Wait, it's like 2am.)
            Me: (Hmm...)
            Me: (Maybe she isn't sleeping?)
            Me: (I could go peek into her room, or send her a text.)
            Me: (What to do, what to do...)
                Me: (What to do, what to do...)
            Narator: You notice a notification from an unknown number.
            Me: (Who's that?)
            Narator: Opening the message, you're shocked to see a picture of yourself, nude.
            Me: (WHAT THE HELL?!)
            Me: {i}(Naomi...){/i}
            Narator: You consider texting Naomi back...
                Narator: You consider texting Naomi back...
                    Me: (You know what? I will text her back.)
                    Me: \"I'm beginning to regret giving you my number.\"
                    Naomi: \"Oh, come on... It's just a joke. ;P\"
                    Naomi: \"So, you're still up?\"
                    Me: \"So are you.\"
                    Naomi: \"Yeah, I am.\"
                    Naomi: \"Sleeping on these beds is a travesty...\"
                    Me: \"Better than sleeping in the barn.\"
                    Naomi: \"Lmao. Yeah, right. Is there even a barn here?\"
                    Me: \"Lol, no.\"
                    Naomi: \"Didn't think so. lol\"
                    Naomi: \"It's so cold out here...\"
                    Naomi: \"Why don't you come and warm me up?\"
                    Me: \"What?!\"
                    Naomi: \"Joooooking.\"
                        Naomi: \"Although... I wouldn't mind you bringing me a spare sweater.\"
                        Naomi: \"I'm freezing my tits off tonight.\"
                        Me: \"We wouldn't want that, now.\"
                        Naomi: \"I'm sure {i}you{/i} wouldn't. lol\"
                        Naomi: \"Anyway, I'll let you go.\"
                        Naomi: \"I'm sure you're tired.\"
                        Me: \"Night, Naomi.\"
                        Naomi: \"Anyway, I'll let you go.\"
                        Naomi: \"I'm sure you're tired.\"
                        Me: \"Night, Naomi.\"
                        Me: (Was she being serious?)
                        Me: (If she really is cold, I should bring her that sweater...)
                        Me: (Wouldn't want those tits freezing off.)
                        Me: (What if she's joking, though?)
                        Me: (Why would she? We have a good relationship...)
                        Narator: You think what to do for a moment, before making a decision.
                        Me: (What should I do?)
                            Me: (What should I do?)
                                Narator: You decide to be a gentleman, and bring Naomi a sweater.
                                Me: (It'll probably be a little big for her petite body...)
                                Me: (But, it should do.)
                                Me: Pssst! Naomi.
                                Naomi: Oh, you actually came?
                                Naomi: With... a sweater?
                                Naomi: (He's sweet...)
                                Me: Didn't you want me to bring you one?
                                Naomi: Yeah, yeah.
                                Naomi: Thanks, [m!t].
                                Naomi: Come in. Let's chat a little.
                                Me: Wouldn't we wake Violet up?
                                Naomi: Oh, Violet? No. She sleeps really soundly.
                                Naomi: Probably because of all that exercise she gets during the day.
                                Me: You sure?
                                Naomi: Certain.
                                Naomi: Come in, please.
                                Naomi: Sit down.
                                Naomi: Thanks again for making sure I don't freeze my tits off...
                                Me: *Chuckle* No problem, Naomi.
                                Me: We wouldn't want that to happen.
                                    Naomi: So, what are you really doing out here?
                                        Naomi: Oh really? What would you have done if I told you it was just a joke?
                                            Naomi: Oh really? What would you have done if I told you it was just a joke?
                                                Me: I guess I would have gone back to the house.
                                        Me: Well, I wanted to spend a little more time with you...
                                            Naomi: How sweet... And, what did you want to do with me?
                                Naomi: Oh, do I?
                                Me: Yeah...
                                Naomi: Well, [m!t]...
                                Naomi: Who knew you'd grow a pair so quickly.
                                Me: Hey, what the hell?
                                Me: I came here to bring you a sweater...
                                Me: Not to be insulted.
                                Naomi: [m!ct]... Don't take it so seriously...
                                Naomi: I was just joking.
                                Me: It didn't seem like it...
                                Naomi: You know what?
                                Naomi: I'll make it up to you...
                                Naomi: ...by letting you choose where we go from here.
                                Me: Well...
                                Me: I think I have an idea...
                                    Me: I think I have an idea...
                                        Me: How about you...
                                        Me: Give me a handy?
                                        Naomi: You want me to...
                                        Naomi: *Sigh* Sure... sure.
                                        Naomi: I think I owe it to you.
                                        Naomi: I haven't really shown you my soft side yet...
                                        Naomi: Just relax...
                                        Naomi: Go with the flow.
                                        Me: Okay...
                                        Naomi: Does {i}this{/i} feel good, [m!t]?
                                        Me: Yeah... it does.
                                        Naomi: Good.
                                        Naomi: Stay like that...
                                        Naomi: I think {i}this{/i} will feel {i}much{/i} better...
                                        Me: Oh?
                                        Naomi: Be patient...
                                        Me: Mmmm... Yeah...
                                        Me: That feels amazing...
                                        Naomi: Focus on that feeling...
                                        Naomi: Because this might not happen again soon.
                                        Me: Why... not?
                                        Naomi: Because you're not serving {i}me.{/i}
                                        Me: Mmm... Oohh...
                                        Me: I'll have to, next time.
                                        Naomi: You...
                                        Naomi: Better.
                                        Me: Aaah!
                                        Naomi: SSshhh...
                                        Naomi: You need to stay quieter...
                                        Me: *Muffled moan* MMffmm...
                                        Naomi: Moan as much as you want.
                                        Naomi: Nobody will hear you.
                                        Me: *Muffled moan*
                                        Me: *Muffled* Mmmff!
                                        Naomi: I like this reaction...
                                        Naomi: Maybe I should... {i}stroke harder.{/i}
                                        Me: *Muffled moan* Mmmff!
                                        Narator: As you moan in ecstasy into Naomi's hand...
                                        Narator: Your cock twitches and throbs.
                                        Narator: As your ecstasy reaches its peak, your hot load flies toward Naomi.
                                        Narator: She managed to dodge most of it, however, some semen got on her hands.
                                        Me: Aaah... yeah...
                                        Naomi: Did you discover a new kink?
                                        Me: *Quiet chuckle* I don't think so...
                                        Naomi: Awww...
                                        Naomi: Maybe I'll have to try something else, next time...
                                        Me: Next time?
                                        Naomi: Yeah...
                                        Naomi: {i}If you're good.{/i}
                                        Me: *Quiet gasp* Oooh... {i}I'm excited.{/i}
                                        Naomi: *Yawn* You should be.
                                        Me: Am I boring you?
                                        Naomi: Of course not...
                                        Naomi: I'm just tired, and it's pretty late.
                                        Me: Yeah, it is.
                                        Me: I'll head out, and let you go to sleep.
                                        Naomi: Thanks for bringing the sweater, [m!t].
                                        Me: No problem.
                                        Me: Night, Naomi.
                                        Naomi: Night, [m!t].
                                        Me: How about you...
                                        Me: Just enjoy my touch?
                                        Naomi: You want me to...
                                        Naomi: Let you touch me?
                                        Naomi: Sure, I'm happy with that choice.
                                        Naomi: I love it when you serve {i}me...{/i}
                                        Naomi: Here. Easier?
                                        Me: Much easier...
                                        Me: First, I'll start here...
                                        Naomi: Too bad it's so cold out tonight...
                                        Me: You don't want to take the sweater off?
                                        Naomi: I'd rather not...
                                        Me: That's fine, because I'm moving elsewhere...
                                        Naomi: Oooh... Taking your time?
                                        Me: I'm just giving you the time to enjoy it.
                                        Me: You've got such a great ass...
                                        Naomi: You like it?
                                        Me: Yeah, it's perfect.
                                        Me: But...
                                        Me: I like {i}this{/i} more.
                                        Naomi: Ahhh...
                                        Naomi: So, you've fallen under her spell?
                                        Me: It seems so.
                                        Naomi: Mmmff... Good.
                                        Me: But, I think it would be better if these weren't in the way.
                                        Naomi: Did I tell you to do that?
                                        Me: I thought I was here to serve you?
                                        Naomi: Well... Okay.
                                        Naomi: You're right.
                                        Me: Then, just {i}enjoy{/i} this...
                                        Naomi: *Quiet moan* Fuuu...
                                        Naomi: Mmmm...
                                        Naomi: Keep going, [m!t]...
                                        Me: If you insist.
                                        Naomi: Mmmf...
                                        Me: You're dripping wet...
                                        Naomi: Because you're driving me crazy...
                                        Me: Do you want me to stick them in?
                                        Naomi: I've been waiting for you to say that...
                                        Naomi: ...since you started.
                                        Naomi: OOoaaahhh... Mmm...
                                        Me: You like this?
                                        Naomi: Ssshh...
                                        Naomi: Just keep going...
                                        Me: Harder?
                                        Naomi: Whatever you want to do to me...
                                            Naomi: Whatever you want to do to me...
                                                Me: I'll keep it gentle, Naomi.
                                                Naomi: I think Violet will appreciate that.
                                                Me: What? Why Violet?
                                                Naomi: *Whispers* Because, I can't help myself sometimes...
                                                Naomi: Who knows how loud I'd be yelping...
                                                Me: I don't know if I'm happy to hear that, or slightly disappointed...
                                                Naomi: Oh, it'll still be {i}sexy...{/i}
                                                Naomi: Refocus, [m!t]...
                                                Naomi: Mmmmmm... Feels amazing...
                                                Naomi: Keep going...
                                                Naomi: *Quiet moans* Fuuuuuucccckkk...
                                                Naomi: I'm... I'm...
                                                Naomi: I'm gonna cum...
                                                Me: I won't stop you.
                                                Naomi: Mmmff... Yes...
                                                Naomi: Aaaaah...
                                                Me: Was it good?
                                                Naomi: It felt nice...
                                                Naomi: Next time, when Violet isn't here...
                                                Naomi: You'll have to do it {i}harder.{/i}
                                                Me: Did Violet wake up?
                                                Naomi: No, I don't think so.
                                                Naomi: See? She's a heavy sleeper.
                                                Naomi: Just like I said.
                                                Me: I guess you're right.
                                                Naomi: *Yawn* Of course I am.
                                                Me: Am I boring you?
                                                Naomi: No... I'm just tired, and it's pretty late.
                                                Me: Yeah, it is.
                                                Me: I'll head out, and let you go to sleep.
                                                Naomi: Thanks for bringing the sweater, [m!t].
                                                Me: No problem.
                                                Me: Night, Naomi.
                                                Naomi: Night, [m!t].
                                                Me: I'll show you...
                                                Me: ...my {i}strength.{/i}
                                                Naomi: Huh?
                                                Naomi: FUUUU-- Feels amazing...
                                                Naomi: Keep going...
                                                Naomi: *Moans* Fuuuuuucccckkk...
                                                Naomi: I'm... I'm!
                                                Naomi: *Yelping* I'm gonna cum!
                                                Me: I won't stop you.
                                                Naomi: Mmmff... Yes!
                                                Naomi: Aaaaah...
                                                Me: Was it good?
                                                Naomi: It felt nice...
                                                Violet: (Oh... My god...)
                                                Violet: (Is she really?)
                                                Violet: (Is HE really?)
                                                Violet: (I... I can't believe this...)
                                                Naomi: Shit, I may have gotten a liiiittle loud...
                                                Me: Do you think we woke Violet up?
                                                Naomi: I don't think so.
                                                Naomi: She sleeps like a hibernating bear.
                                                Naomi: Don't worry about it.
                                                Me: If you say so...
                                                Me: You're her cabinmate after all.
                                                Naomi: *Yawn* Just relax, [m!t]...
                                                Me: Oh, am I boring you?
                                                Naomi: No... I'm just tired, and it's pretty late.
                                                Me: Yeah, it is.
                                                Me: I'll head out, and let you go to sleep.
                                                Naomi: Thanks for bringing the sweater, [m!t].
                                                Naomi: *Whisper* And, for serving me so well.
                                                Me: *Quiet chuckle* It's my pleasure.
                                                Me: Night, Naomi.
                                                Naomi: Night, [m!t].
                                Naomi: Oh, really?
                                Naomi: I can't say I'm surprised to hear that...
                                Naomi: *Sigh* Thanks for being honest with me, though.
                                Me: It's the least I can do.
                                Naomi: Hmm...
                                Naomi: You know what?
                                Me: What?
                                Naomi: Since you've been honest with me, I'll be honest with you.
                                Naomi: I'll let you in on a little something...
                                Me: And, what is that?
                                Naomi: Oh, you'll see soon enough.
                                Naomi: Just relax...
                                Naomi: Go with the flow.
                                Me: Okay...
                                Naomi: Does {i}this{/i} feel good, [m!t]?
                                Me: Yeah... it does.
                                Naomi: Perfect.
                                Naomi: Stay like that...
                                Me: Oh?
                                Naomi: Be patient...
                                Me: Mmmm... Yeah...
                                Me: Wait a second...
                                Me: Those are in the way.
                                Naomi: {i}Naughty.{/i}
                                Naomi: Allow me...
                                Me: Wow...
                                Naomi: Enjoy the view?
                                Me: Hell yeah...
                                Me: Shiiit...
                                Naomi: You better enjoy this as long as you can...
                                Naomi: Who knows when you'll get the chance again.
                                Me: Yeah... Naomi...
                                Naomi: Mmmmf...
                                Naomi: This is so good...
                                Naomi: For a peasant.
                                Me: Ha... ha...
                                Naomi: Oh... shit...
                                Naomi: Yeah...
                                Naomi: Oh...
                                Naomi: Ooohh...
                                Me: I'm gonna...
                                Naomi: Me... too...
                                Naomi: Cum... for me.
                                Naomi: What the hell?
                                Naomi: You couldn't be decent, and cum on yourself?
                                Me: Sorry...
                                Me: But... they say it's good for the skin.
                                Me: So, in a way...
                                Me: I'm doing you a favor.
                                Naomi: Are you, now?
                                Naomi: I don't think I asked for a semen moisturization regimen...
                                Naomi: But, it's okay.
                                Me: I really couldn't help it.
                                Naomi: I know...
                                Naomi: *Whisper* {i}Maybe I like it.{/i}
                                Naomi: Did you like it?
                                Me: I loved it...
                                Naomi: Good.
                                Naomi: Now I've got you wrapped around my finger.
                                Me: Should I be scared?
                                Naomi: Uhh... why?
                                Me: Because, when you got here, you told me you killed a man with your pussy.
                                Naomi: *Quiet chuckle* I guess you'll just have to be good...
                                Naomi: Otherwise, you might find out.
                                Me: *Quiet gasp* {i}I'm terrified.{/i}
                                Naomi: *Yawn* You should be.
                                Me: Am I boring you?
                                Naomi: No... I'm just tired, and it's pretty late.
                                Me: Yeah, it is.
                                Me: I'll head out, and let you go to sleep.
                                Naomi: Thanks for bringing the sweater, [m!t].
                                Me: No problem.
                                Me: Night, Naomi.
                                Naomi: Night, [m!t].
                        Narator: You decide to stay in bed, browsing the internet a bit.
                        Narator: Eventually, your eyes begin to burn and sleep begins to take you.
                        Me: (What time is it?)
                        Me: (Damn, it's 2am.)
                        Me: (I should probably just go to sleep.)
                        Narator: Deciding smartly to go to sleep, you put your phone down.
                    Me: (She's probably already asleep...)
                    Me: (Wouldn't want to disturb her beauty sleep.)
                    Narator: You browse the internet a bit, eventually getting bored.
                    Narator: However, before putting your phone down...
                    Narator: You see an old message from Kiara.
                    Kiara: \"I'm so happy you're coming back this summer!\"
                    Kiara: \"Can't wait to see you!\"
                    Me: (Oh. Kiara...)
                        Me: (\"The dreaded Forest Sucker.\")
                    Me: *Chuckles*
                    Narator: As you stop chuckling to yourself, you feel a strange urge...
                    Me: (Should I reach out to her?)
                    Me: (Wait, it's like 2am.)
                    Me: (Hmm...)
                    Me: (Maybe she isn't sleeping?)
                    Me: (I could go peek into her room, or send her a text.)
                    Me: (What to do, what to do...)
                        Me: (What to do, what to do...)
                            Narator: You take a gamble and decide to text Kiara.
                            Me: (Fuck it, why not?)
                            Me: Hey, Kiara. You up?
                            Me: (This is stupid. She's probably sleeping...)
                            Narator: But, despite your disbelief, Kiara responds.
                            Kiara: \"I am now. What's up?\"
                            Me: \"I just wanted to see how you are...\"
                            Me: \"Especially after our talk, earlier.\"
                            Kiara: \"I feel a lot better...\"
                            Kiara: \"Thanks for understanding.\"
                            Kiara: \"Again, I'm sorry.\"
                            Me: \"It's okay, Kiara.\"
                            Me: \"It's in the past.\"
                            Kiara: \"Thanks for texting...\"
                            Kiara: \"Good night, again.\"
                            Me: \"Night, Kiara.\"
                            Me: (You know? I'm happy I texted her.)
                            Me: (I'll sleep much better, now.)
                            Me: (Quietly...)
                            Me: (Almost there...)
                            Me: (I think she's sleeping...)
                            Kiara: Huh?
                            Me: (Shit!)
                            Kiara: Who's there?
                            Me: Kiara, it's me. [m!t].
                            Kiara: [m!ct]? What are you doing in my room?
                            Kiara: Why'd you wake me up?
                            Me: I just wanted to see if you were awake.
                            Me: It was stupid, I know.
                            Kiara: Yeah, you woke me up...
                            Kiara: But, it's okay.
                            Kiara: Well... What's up?
                            Me: Are you...
                            Me: Are you okay?
                            Kiara: Yeah, I'm fine...
                                Kiara: Honestly, I should be asking {i}you{/i} that...
                                Kiara: Especially after what I did to you.
                                Me: It's okay, Kiara...
                                Kiara: No, it's not. It's really messed up, [m!t].
                                Kiara: *Sigh* Sometimes, I think spending so many summers with mental patients...
                                Kiara: ...has fucked me up a little.
                                Me: You've had to deal with pretty stressful shit, Kiara.
                                Me: Even though you {i}did{/i} tie me up and suck my dick...
                                Me: (...while I was seeing someone...)
                                Me: ...I'd say you're doing fine.
                                Kiara: Thanks for forgiving me...
                                Me: No problem, Kiara.
                                Kiara: *Sigh* I still feel like I need to make it up to you...
                                Me: You... do?
                                Me: (I won't refuse.)
                                Kiara: Yeah. I didn't get a chance to finish what I started the other night...
                                Kiara: Wouldn't want to leave you unsatisfied.
                                Kiara: Come here...
                                Kiara: Where was I?
                                Kiara: Like this, right?
                                Me: Yeah, I think so.
                                Kiara: And, you were like this.
                                Me: Actually, I think I was like {i}this.{/i}
                                Kiara: You're right... I think you were like that.
                                Kiara: And, I was doing this.
                                Me: Oh, yeah...
                                Kiara: You like that?
                                Kiara: Just focus on the pleasure...
                                Kiara: Grab my hair, [m!t].
                                Me: Are you sure, Kiara?
                                Kiara: Pull me in hard, I can take it.
                                Kiara: MMph. Mmm. Yeah.
                                Me: You like that?
                                Kiara: Mhmmmm.
                                Me: (She's making it up to me nicely...)
                                Me: Ahh... Kiara...
                                Kiara: Mmmph. Aah!
                                Me: Ah, Kiara... I'm gonna...
                                Kiara: Mmph. Give it to me, [m!t].
                                Kiara: (So much...)
                                Kiara: Did I make it up to you properly?
                                Me: Yeah... I think you did.
                                Me: That was amazing, Kiara.
                                Kiara: Good, wouldn't want you all pent-up before sleep.
                                Kiara: Good night, [m!t].
                                Me: Good night, Kiara.
                                Me: (I'm glad that's behind us, now.)
                                Me: (What wild shit will happen tomorrow?)
                                Me: (I wonder.)
                                Kiara: I'm just surprised to see you...
                                Kiara: Especially after what I did to you.
                                Me: It's okay, Kiara...
                                Kiara: No, it's not. It's really messed up, [m!t].
                                Kiara: *Sigh* Sometimes, I think spending so many summers with mental patients...
                                Kiara: ...has fucked me up a little.
                                Me: You've had to deal with pretty stressful shit, Kiara.

                                Me: No problem, Kiara.
                                Me: I'll let you go back to sleep, now.
                                Kiara: Okay. Night, [m!t].
                                Me: Night, Kiara.
                                Me: (I'm glad that's behind us, now.)
                                Me: (What crazy shit will happen tomorrow?)
                                Me: (I wonder.)
                            Me: (It's 2am.)
                            Me: (The screen is blinding me...)
                            Me: (I should probably just go to sleep.)
                            Narator: Deciding smartly to go to sleep, you put your phone down.
Me: *Yawn* (I'm exhausted.)
Me: (Time for sleep...)
Narator: You get up to take off your day clothes...
Narator: ...and get into bed.
Me: What a day...
Me: I wonder what wild things will happen tomorrow.
