m "I finally got a good night's sleep."
m "(Pretty easy when Eve isn't assigning me early-bird chores...)"
n "You get dressed and make your way onto the landing."
m "(Hmm... It doesn't sound like anyone else is up yet.)"
m "(What time is it anyway?)"
n "Continuing downstairs, and walking into the kitchen, you're greeted by..."
n "...an empty room."
m "(I guess everybody is sleeping in.)"
m "(Is there any coffee?)"

m "(Guess not.)"

m "(Ah, whatever.)"
m "(I guess everybody needs their beauty sleep sometimes.)"

m "(Oh thank Christ, the machine was pre-loaded.)"
m "(I've been gone so long...)"
m "(...I have no idea where they keep the coffee, now.)"
m "(I probably would've gone coffee-less if it wasn't waiting, ready to go.)"
m "(Thanks, Eve.)"
n "The coffee machine stops whirring."
n "And, the red indicator light turns off."
m "Coffee time."
n "You pour yourself a hot cup of coffee."
m "Mmm. Smells delicious."
n "Sipping your coffee, you gaze out the window."
n "Questions about your investigation cross your mind."

m "(...so I can finally move on.)"

m "Ah!"

k "Looks like you were lost in thought."

mo "Good morning, you two."
m "Morning, Eve."
k "Morning!"
m "(She always shows up at the worst time...)"

n "She takes out some yogurt and fruit."
mo "A quick breakfast this morning."
n "Not a moment later, Emily arrives in the kitchen."
n "She still seems like she's waking up."
em "*Yawn* Morning, peeps."
mo "Peeps? Morning, Emily."
n "Emily looks over at you and smiles."
n "She then shifts her gaze to Kiara and makes a face."
k "Hmph."
mo "Everybody, grab some coffee and breakfast."
mo "We'll be starting soon."
n "Everybody grabs some fruit and yogurt."
n "And those who haven't already poured themselves coffee, now do."
n "Sitting at the table, now, everyone waits for Eve to begin."
mo "Okay. Thanks everyone."
mo "Good morning, again."
mo "Today is another big day..."
mo "The patients will be busy, most of the day..."
mo "But, we will have a bit of a shindig this evening."
mo "We're going to have a barbecue this evening."
mo "However, that's the bookend for a day of intensive therapy."
m "(What the hell is Eve going to do to them?)"
k "Intensive?"
em "Sounds stressful."
mo "Well, for some patients it may be."
mo "I suppose..."
mo "That all depends on the results of their pre-evaluations. "
mo "That's the first course of action."
mo "Throughout the day they'll have individual therapy..."
mo "Determined by the results of their pre-evaluations."
mo "Does that make sense to you guys?"
mo "Mostly, the task will be escorting them here and there."
mo "Kiara. You'll go to the city to get things for the barbecue."
mo "Emily, and [m!t]..."
mo "You'll be in charge of accompanying the girls, today."
m "(Are we really just glorified chauffers?)"
mo "Does everyone understand their tasks?"
m "Yes."
em "Yep, all clear."
k "Toss me the keys, and I'll be on my way."
n "Eve tosses the keys to Kiara..."

m "(Damn, she's good.)"
n "Kiara stands up from her seat at the table."
k "See you guys later."
k "I shouldn't be gone too long."
n "She smiles at you while walking toward the front door."
m "See you."
em "Hrmph."
mo "Please don't crash the car..."
k "That's something [m!t] would do, not me!"

m "(If she's hiding anything, she's hiding it well.)"
mo "You two."

em "Where?"

em "Okay! See ya soon."
mo "You better get going too, [m!t]."
m "I was just about to."
m "See you soon."
mo "Bye, [m!t]."
n "You stand up from your seat at the table,"

    n "...yanking you with her."
    m "Hey!"
    em "*Giggle* There's no time to waste!"
    n "Emily keeps yanking your wrist while dragging you onto the path."
    n "Out on the path, you break her hold on your wrist."
    m "(Ouch, she gave me an Indian burn...)"
    m "Why are you so excited all of a sudden?"
    em "Because I get to hang with you!"
    em "(And because {i}she's{/i} gone.)"
    m "So, uhh..."
    m "You sleep well?"

    n "Soon, both of you arrive at the girls' campground."
    em "We're here!"
    n "Emily skips ahead of you, toward the cabins."
    n "As you follow Emily, she keeps her distance."
    m "Em, wait up!"

    n "However, you pick up the pace and catch up to her."
    m "Emily..."
    m "Are you still upset about last night?"
    em "Hrmph. What if I am?"
    m "You can't stay mad at me forever..."
    em "So I should just stop right now?"

    m "I really didn't mean anything by it, Emily..."
    m "I was just confused."
    em "You sure are confused a lot..."
    m "Maybe I got hit in the head too many times playing sports."
    em "*Giggle* That would explain it..."
    n "You and Emily walk quietly the rest of the way."
    n "However, by the time you arrive at the campground..."
    n "She seems more cheerful."
    m "(Is she faking it, or did she forgive me?)"
    n "Emily walks ahead of you, toward the girls' cabins."

    em "Let's get to it, [m!t]."

    m "I actually feel really well-rested."
    em "Maybe because you feel like..."

    m "Maybe..."
    m "But, I {i}was{/i} wondering..."
    m "Can you give me any more hints?"
        em "Maybe I can. What's on your mind?"

                em "Finally asking the right questions! No, they're not."
    em "Bingo!"
    n "Emily claps for your successful deduction."
    m "Hey... Don't patronize me!"
    m "I just wanted to be certain..."

        nao "Are you going to do... anything?"
        m "Oh, I was just waiting for you to start."
        nao "Waiting for {i}me?{/i}"
        m "I just wanted to follow {i}your{/i} lead."
        nao "Wow..."
        n "Naomi, frustrated by your decision, picks up the rake and begins raking."
        n "Taking your cue, you put on the gardening gloves."
        n "Focused on the task at hand, you begin pulling out the weeds and dry brush."
        n "At first, Naomi looks annoyed by how you acted..."
        n "However, after a bit more time watching you work hard, she speaks."
        nao "Hey, [m!t]..."
        m "Yeah?"
        nao "I'm still not over your approach to getting me working..."
        nao "But, I appreciate that you helped me out immediately."
        nao "Well, after your initial stunt, actually."
        m "No problem, Naomi."
        m "I'm actually happy to help you."
        m "I think we'll get this done pretty quickly, as a team."
        nao "So... [m!ct]..."
        nao "When did you become such a gentleman?"
        m "(Woah, where did that comment come from?)"
        m "*Chuckle* You say that like I wasn't one, before."
        nao "*Laugh* Well... You've made great progress recently."
        m "Thank you, my lady."

        nao "*Chuckle* [m!ct], I'm just fucking with you."
        m "Yeah, heh. I knew you were."
n "You both continue working happily and efficiently."
n "Soon, you're nearly done with Naomi's task."
m "Hey, Naomi?"
nao "Yes?"
m "Are you..."
m "...having a good time with me, today?"
n "Naomi stops raking, and looks directly into your eyes."
nao "I'm actually having a really nice time here, with you."
nao "Despite the reason we're out here."
nao "Thanks for talking to me..."
nao "(And, for opening up to me.)"
m "Maybe we'll get more opportunities to hang out, one-on-one."
nao "If we do, I just hope it won't involve more yard work."
nao "You really want to know?"
nao "Ugh. Okay..."
nao "Prepare yourself."
m "I'm listening."
nao "So... This is what happened..."
nao "My mother was never a {i}kind{/i} woman..."
nao "She was a spoiled princess, born into wealth..."
nao "And, I know what you might be thinking..."
nao "Everyone's said the same thing about me, my whole life."
m "Naomi, I wasn't going to--"
nao "It doesn't matter."
nao "So. She was a princess born with a silver spoon in her mouth."
nao "Her parents, my grandparents, never paid any attention to her..."
nao "Instead, they showered her with gifts."
nao "Dresses, makeup, earrings... Whatever she wanted."
m "And, that spoiled her?"
nao "Exactly."
nao "She was accustomed to living the high-life..."
nao "But, she was cut off by her parents when she turned 30."
nao "She never really tried to make anything of herself."
nao "She just spent, spent, spent."
nao "But, instead of getting some kind of job to support her lifestyle..."
nao "She chose the easy route."
m "She married rich."
nao "Yep."
nao "She found a new sponsor."
nao "At first, she kept her spending somewhat reasonable."
nao "But, once she saw my dad's career developments..."
nao "She saw that as her green light to go wild."
nao "As he made more money, she spent more."
nao "She also has other vices, though..."
nao "Particularly wine and young men."
nao "I overheard her on the phone one day..."
nao "Drunk, a glass of champagne in hand..."
nao "She was arranging a meetup with one of her \"toys\"..."
m "(So, her mom is a MILF?)"
m "([m!ct], stay focused...)"
nao "I was furious!"
nao "She was spending my dad's money, which made him busier and busier..."
nao "And she had the fucking {i}balls{/i} to go behind his back like that?!"
nao "So, of course I told him."
nao "She went psycho."
nao "That lying bitch made up some BS about me..."
nao "But, I still managed to make my dad suspicious of my mom."
nao "He hired a private investigator, who collected all the dirt my dad needed."
nao "They're getting divorced."
m "Wait..."
m "Is that why you're here?"
m "Because of the lie your mom told about you?"
nao "Yeah."
nao "But, I'd rather not get into that right now."
m "Wait, so your dad bought what she said?"
nao "[m!ct], please. Not now..."
m "(Why would her dad believe his cheating wife, and send Naomi here?)"
m "Okay... I won't push it."
nao "{i}Thank you.{/i}"
m "Thank {i}you{/i}, Naomi... for opening up to me."
nao "WOW!"
nao "Who knew you could be such an asshole!?"
n "Naomi angrily throws the rake to the ground."
m "(Why did I need to poke the bear?)"
m "Look... Naomi."
nao "Fuck off!"
m "(I should just leave her alone...)"
m "(I'm only making her angrier being here.)"
n "You keep doing Naomi's chores for a while..."
n "...before you speak up again."
m "Naomi..."
m "I was being an idiot."
nao "Yes, you were."
m "And... I really am sorry."
m "I've been rude to you for no real reason..."
nao "Yes, {i}you have.{/i}"
nao "You'll have to do much more to make it up to me..."
nao "But, for now, we can remain civil."
m "Oh thank god..."
nao "Don't thank god, thank {i}me!{/i}"
m "(Her ego is GARGANTUAN...)"
m "Okay."
m "Thank {i}you,{/i} Naomi."
n "Naomi smiles at you with warm kindness..."
n "...and growing affection."
nao "You're a nice guy, [m!t]."
m "(Huh?)"
m "Uh, thanks, Naomi."
m "I think you're a nice girl, too."
nao "Do you, now?"
nao "When I first got to camp, you had this look on your face..."
nao "You were judging me."
nao "So, I fulfilled your warped expectations of me."
m "I didn't know you then."
m "Now that I do, I'd never think the same."
nao "Do you really mean it?"
m "I do."
m "I think I actually understand you..."
nao "Oh, do you?"
m "At least better than before."
m "(I'm sure there are even more quirks to your personality...)"
nao "There's no denying that."
nao "*Giggle* You're actually not as dumb as I thought you were."
m "Heh. Thanks, I guess."
nao "That's a compliment!"
nao "You also have a nice bod."
m "Uh, thanks, Naomi."
m "(So do you.)"
n "As you and Naomi finish clearing the campsite..."
n "Eve arrives, ready to hear how it all went."
mo "Wow!"
mo "The area looks great, guys!"
mo "You both did a wonderful job."
nao "Why, thank you!"
mo "So, how did that feel, Naomi?"
mo "That wasn't too difficult, now, was it?"
nao "Actually... It wasn't that terrible."
nao "*Softly* [m!t] actually helped out a lot."
mo "Hmm... How kind of him."
m "It was nothing."
mo "Naomi. You and I will have a short debrief later in the day."
mo "At the moment, I'm a bit behind schedule."
mo "So, [m!t], why don't you show Naomi back to the campground?"
m "It would be my pleasure."
mo "Wonderful. See you both later."
m "Shall we?"
nao "After you."
m "Well, here we are."
nao "You were quite a fine \"chauffer\"."
nao "You're dismissed for the time being."
m "If you insist."
m "Till we meet again."
nao "Toodles, [m!t]!"
n "Having been dismissed by Naomi, you decide to head back to the house."
m "Ahh... (I finally have a little time to relax...)"
n "You make your way back through the campground, and to the house."
n "Outside, you hear voices trailing off toward the Community Area's deck."
m "Hmm... (I wonder who that could be?)"
n "Curious who it is, you walk around the house to hear the voices better."
n "Getting closer to the source, you realize the voices belong to Eve..."
mo "Please be more cooperative..."
n "...and Belle."
b "Uggghh! I'm trying!"
b "I just can't help it."
b "My mind loves going there..."
m "(She has to be talking about sex.)"
mo "Well, since your mind is allegedly uncontrollable..."
mo "...I believe our best course of action is to do some meditation."
b "Oooh... Anything kinky?"
mo "Of course not!"
mo "But, I think it will help you take your therapy more seriously."
mo "Hmmm... I think the dock would be the perfect place to meditate."
mo "Nobody should be there to interrupt us."
n "Thinking quick, you walk back toward the front door."
m "(So, Eve and Belle are gonna meditate?)"
m "(Really? Just meditation?)"
m "(I'm curious to see how that will go...)"
m "(Especially with Belle's tendency to get... distracted.)"
m "(I mean, I {i}could{/i} also just chill on the couch for a bit.)"
m "(Both options sound pretty good.)"
n "You stand there a moment longer, wondering what you should do."
m "(Hmm...)"
        m "(Hmm...)"
m "(I think going to the dock is the better choice...)"
m "(It'll {i}definitely{/i} be more entertaining than TV.)"
n "You walk away from the house, and down the path."
m "(Every day I learn new things about these girls...)"
m "(I'm actually starting to get used to their quirks.)"
m "Heh. (I'd say they're starting to get used to mine, too.)"
m "(This is gonna be interesting...)"
m "(I wonder how quickly Belle will drive poor Eve crazy...)"
m "(Hopefully she cooperates. Despite how boring that might be.)"
m "(If there were more to do at camp...)"
m "(I wouldn't have to entertain myself by eavesdropping...)"
m "(Ah, whatever.)"
n "Soon, you make it to the area near the dock."
m "(Okay, now that I'm here...)"
m "(Where can I hide?)"
m "(Hmm... It looks like I have three options.)"
m "(I can hide behind the changing booth.)"
m "(I can... hide behind this rock? Maybe?)"
m "(Or, I can just sit on the edge of the dock, and act casual.)"
m "(What should I do...)"
m "(The rock?)"
m "(Uhh... Sure, sure.)"
m "(I guess this is a decent enough spot.)"
n "You crouch down, attempting to hide behind the average-sized rock."
n "While crouched, and \"hidden,\" you spot someone near the edge of the lake..."
m "(Who's that, over there?)"
n "It's Emily."
m "(What's Emily doing over there?)"
m "(It looks like she's... skipping stones?)"
m "(If she spots me behind this rock, I'm screwed.)"
n "As you think that dreadful thought..."
n "...Emily skips one more stone..."
n "...before she notices you crouched behind the rock."
em "Oh, hi [m!t]!"
m "(Damn, she noticed me!)"
n "Realizing your cover is blown, you stand up, greeting Emily."
m "Hey, Em!"
n "She walks over to you, smiling as she does."
m "How's it going?"
em "Good, just skipping stones!"
em "What were you doing hiding behind this rock?"
em "Spying on meeee?"
m "*Chuckle* No, no..."
m "(Quick, come up with something!)"
m "I was just... looking for salamanders."
em "(What? Salamanders?)"
em "I didn't take you for a herpetologist."
m "A herpe-what now?"
em "A herpetologist."
em "Someone who studies reptiles and amphibians."
m "Where'd you learn that?"
em "That TV channel. World Wild Web."
m "Aha, makes sense."
m "To answer your question, no. I'm not."
m "I just thought I saw one scurry under this rock."
m "And, uhh... decided to investigate."
em "Oh? So, you're a reptile detective now?"
m "I... I guess so, Em."
em "*Giggle*"
em "Smart choice, [m!t]."
em "Starting with the easier cases, and working your way up."
m "Yep, you gotta start somewhere."
m "Anyway..."
m "Sorry for interrupting your stone skipping."
em "It's okay. Do you wanna join me?"
m "(My cover is already blown... So, why not?)"
m "Sure, that would be cool."
n "You give up on your feeble attempt at blending in with the environment."
n "Instead, smartly deciding to join Emily at the lake's edge."
n "You pick up a small, flat stone from the lake's shore."
m "(Flat, angled parallel to the water, and--)"
n "You flick your wrist, sending the rock flying."
n "You both watch it skip three times, then fumble and sink into the water."
m "(A decent attempt...)"
em "Good job, [m!t]!"
em "But, {i}watch this.{/i}"
n "Emily bends down..."
n "...and grabs a smooth, flat stone."
n "She brings it to her lips, and gives it a tiny kiss."
em "For good luck, ya know?"
m "Whatever helps."
m "(Does she kiss every single stone she throws?)"
n "Emily then bends down a bit..."
n "...closes one eye..."
n "...and winds her arm up."
em "Aaaaaandd!"
n "The rock flies from the palm of her hand, along her fingertips..."
n "...and away, skipping across the lake's surface."
n "The stone skips 7 times before faltering, sinking into the water."
em "Yes! A personal best!"
m "(Woah, she's way better at that than I am.)"
m "Great job! Looks like you've been practicing."
em "You noticed?"
m "I mean, yeah. How could I not?"
m "You beat me by more than double my amount of skips."
em "Maybe I can let you in on my {i}secret techniques...{/i}"
m "I'd really appreciate that, Em."
n "As Emily begins training you in the ancient art of stone skipping..."
n "You see Eve and Belle begin their session on the dock."
m "(Damn it, I missed my chance to listen in on their meditation session...)"
m "(When did they even get there?)"
em "Hellooooo, [m!t]."
em "Was my lecture that boring?"
m "Huh? Oh, no. Sorry."
m "I zoned out for a second."
em "No prob. Let's continue."
n "As Emily teaches you her tricks, you occasionally glance over at Eve and Belle."
m "(I wonder what they're saying...)"
m "(Ugh. The rock was the worst hiding place I could have chosen.)"
n "Finishing her lecture, Emily gives you the go-ahead to try her techniques."
em "It's time, grasshopper."
em "Let the stone fly."
n "You get into position, as Emily did before."
n "Upon entering perfect form, you whip your arm back..."
n "And, the moment it flings forward, the stone flies out of your hand."
em "Wooooah!"
n "As you watch the stone skip across the lake..."
n "...you glance back at the dock and see Eve and Belle standing up."
n "On the seventh skip the rock sinks into the water."
em "7 skips, [m!t]! You tied my record!"
n "You see Eve and Belle leaving the dock, going back to the campgrounds."
m "(Ugh... They're going back to camp, now.)"
em "You have learned well, grasshopper."
m "Thanks, sensei."
n "In passing, Eve turns toward the two of you and waves."
mo "Hey you two, it's lunch time!"
n "As you begin to walk back toward the camp, Emily grabs your arm."
em "Wait a sec, [m!t]..."
em "There's something I need to admit..."
m "What is it?"
em "I've been manipulating you... a teensy bit."
m "(What the hell does she mean?)"
em "I... {i}maaaay{/i} have been misleading your investigation..."
em "...on purpose."
m "What?"
em "I wanted you to be suspicious of me."
m "What were you thinking?!"
em "I wasn't! That's the problem!"
em "I wanted to spend time with you so badly..."
em "But, you were either busy with Eve's chores..."
em "...or, spending your free time with the new girls."
em "Completely forgetting about me."
m "(Is she serious?)"
em "I felt... invisible to you."
em "[m!ct]... I'm so sorry."
em "I didn't mean to torture you..."
m "I'm shocked... but..."
m "(She seems genuinely apologetic...)"
m "I forgive you."
em "Oh, really, [m!t]?"
em "Thank you, thank you so much."
n "Emily jumps on you, hugging you tightly."
m "Em..."
em "What is it?"
m "You're crushing me."
em "Oh, sorry!"
m "Let's go, Em. Lunch is waiting."
m "(The changing booth is my best bet.)"
m "(But, I might not hear them that well from over there.)"
m "(Better than being caught, though.)"
n "Confident in your choice to hide out behind the changing booth..."
n "You get into position, and eagerly await Eve and Belle."
m "(This is a great hiding spot. They'll never see me over here.)"
n "You wait behind the changing booth wall."
n "Occasionally peeking around the corner, to check for Eve and Belle."
m "(They're really taking their sweet time...)"
n "Eventually, you peek your head around as usual and spot them on the dock."
m "(Finally!)"
m "(Now the show can begin.)"
n "Eve beckons toward the ground, inviting Belle to sit."
mo "Please, sit. Get comfortable."
n "Belle sits down, legs crossed."
n "Shortly after, Eve does the same."
b "Like this? Ooooooommmmmm."
mo "If you're comfortable like that, sure."
mo "But, we won't be chanting any mantras today."
b "Thaaaaat is laaaaameee."
mo "Please, just quiet your mind."
mo "Close your eyes..."
mo "And, listen to my voice."
m "(Huh.)"
m "(I can actually hear them pretty well.)"
m "(Hopefully they keep talking at this volume.)"
mo "Listen to the words..."
mo "Let them resonate within your mind..."
mo "Like the sound of a perfectly tuned bell."
b "I don't hear the bell."
mo "It was a simile, Belle."
mo "Please, focus."
m "(That's going to be the hardest part...)"
m "(Getting her to settle down.)"
n "Belle assumes a good meditative posture and quiets down."
    add "e6a1_5"
    add "e6a1_5_a1"
    add "e6a1_5_a2"
mo "Take a slow... deep... breath."
mo "Inhale fully, and exhale."
b "*Deep breath in*"
b "*Long exhale*"
mo "Good."
mo "Notice your breath..."
mo "Bring all your awareness there."
mo "Slowly allow your awareness to shift..."
mo "Notice the thoughts going through your mind."
n "Eve goes quiet, and pauses for a few moments, allowing Belle to think."
mo "What did you think about?"
b "Well..."
b "At first, I thought about the feeling of a man inside me."
m "(I'm not surprised one bit...)"
mo "Belle, please! Keep it PG."
b "I thought meditation was for the open-minded."
mo "You're--You're right. Please, continue..."
b "Then, I thought about you, in sexy lingerie..."
mo "*Clears throat*"
b "After that, I thought about..."
b "Someone I met recently."
mo "Oh. Is it one of the other patients?"
b "Well, it might be..."
m "(I hope she doesn't mention me...)"
b "But, that doesn't matter right now."
b "There was something beyond all of that, though..."
mo "Please, elaborate..."
b "Well... For some reason, I imagined myself in a room..."
b "From my childhood."
m "(I wonder what her childhood was like...)"
m "(I'd guess she has daddy issues.)"
mo "Can you describe the room for me?"
b "It was a small, square room."
b "Pink walls, with white trim. Like a dollhouse..."
b "I saw my old dolls, my bed, my vanity table, and..."
b "My father came into the room, and the room faded away."
mo "(I wonder what association she has with her father...)"
mo "Thank you, Belle."
mo "Let's continue."
mo "Do not get caught up in your thoughts."
mo "Notice them as they travel across your mind."
mo "Do not focus on them, do not stop them..."
mo "Let them go. Let them pass."
mo "Like water flowing beneath a bridge."
mo "Continue breathing deeply."
mo "I will describe places. Feel them, make them real in your mind."
mo "You see an ocean."
mo "It is deep, and blue..."
mo "Beneath your feet is a sandy beach."
mo "You feel the sand's warmth under your toes."
mo "The ocean's waves change, and become the peaks of sand dunes."
mo "The sand extends from where you stand to the horizon."
mo "It is endless, but you don't feel hot."
mo "It is the perfect temperature, neither hot nor cold."
mo "You feel a breeze, and the sand caresses your cheek."
mo "You look up, and see the vast, endless blue of the sky."
mo "A black dot crosses your vision."
mo "It is the silhouette of a bird."
mo "You focus your eyes on the bird, realizing it's an eagle."
mo "Your eyes follow the eagle, until it lands on the top of a tall pine tree."
mo "You follow the pine tree, down to the earth..."
mo "...realizing you're in a forest."
mo "Recognizing the trees, you see a lake in the distance."
mo "Slowly, you approach the lake..."
mo "As you come closer, two people come into view."
mo "They are sitting on a dock, meditating."
mo "Go toward the {i}you{/i} sitting on the dock."
mo "Rejoin with yourself, and take a final, deep breath."
b "*Deep inhale*"
mo "Good. Now, exhale."
b "*Long exhale*"
mo "And, open your eyes."
mo "Welcome back."
mo "How do you feel?"
b "I feel..."
b "Pretty relaxed."
mo "That's good. Any other feelings?"
b "I feel... oddly content. Lighter."
mo "Good, then our sessions going forward will be more impactful."
b "You think?"
mo "I have a good feeling about it."
m "(She didn't divulge anything interesting...)"
m "(But, I oddly feel like I've been on that mental journey, with Belle.)"
m "(Eve is pretty good at guiding meditations.)"
m "(She could have easily started her own studio, in another life.) "
n "Eve stands up, offering Belle her hand."
mo "Here, take my hand."
b "Gladly."
n "Eve helps Belle up from her seated position."
b "(Eve's hands are so soft...)"
b "Thanks."
mo "Now, let's get you back to your campground."
mo "It's almost lunch time."
m "(Oh, is it?)"
m "(I should wait here a bit before heading over there.)"
m "(Just to make sure they don't suspect me of spying.)"
m "(I think playing it cool would work out best.)"
m "(If anything, they'll just ask me to leave.)"
m "(No biggie.)"
n "Casually, you walk over to the dock."
n "You sit down, letting your legs hang over the edge."
n "Taking in the scenery, you spot Emily at the lake's edge, skipping stones."
n "She notices you too, and waves at you."
n "You wave back at Emily."
n "She smiles at you as she skips another stone."
m "(It's a pretty nice day.)"
m "(Kinda getting hot, though.)"
n "Emily skips a few more stones, while you relax on the dock..."
n "Before Eve and Belle arrive."
mo "Oh, hi [m!t]."
m "Hey Eve."
b "Heeeey, [m!t]. What're you up to?"
m "Just enjoying the lake."
mo "Sorry for doing this... but, you'll need to find another spot."
mo "We need some privacy for Belle's session."
m "Ah, yeah... no prob--"
b "Please, Eve. Let [m!t] join us."
m "(She's really roping {i}me{/i} into this!?)"
mo "I don't think that's a good idea."
b "I think he'd be {i}great{/i} support."
b "I'd feel more relaxed with [m!t] joining in the meditation."
mo "Belle, no."
mo "That would definitely distract you."
b "How is this fair?"
b "Naomi had [m!t]'s support during her session..."
b "That just doesn't seem fair to me."
mo "Well..."
mo "*Sigh* Okay."
mo "If you promise to take this seriously, Belle."
mo "And, if [m!t] promises to be quiet and courteous."
m "Deal."
b "Thanks, Eve!"
mo "Belle, [m!t]."
mo "Please, sit down and get into a comfortable position."
n "You and Belle sit down, cross-legged."
mo "Good. Now, close your eyes."
n "You both follow Eve's suggestion and close your eyes."
mo "Good. Gooood."
mo "Place one hand on your stomach, and one hand on your chest."
n "You and Belle both put your hands where instructed."
mo "Feel your chest rise and fall."
mo "Feel your stomach rise and fall."
mo "Inhale."
mo "Exhale."
n "Seeing you and Belle following along smoothly, and without resistance..."
n "Eve closes her eyes, before continuing to lead the meditation."
mo "Continue breathing naturally, feeling the air flow into your nostrils..."
mo "Then, out through your nostrils."
mo "Continue to feel your breath for a few moments."
n "With eyes closed, you hear all three of you breathing calmly."
mo "*Exhales* On the next inhale, feel your belly rise."
n "Oddly, you feel a sensation near your knee."
m "(Hmm?)"
mo "Then, feel your ribs expand, and your chest lift up."
n "As Eve says this, you feel the sensation move upwards."
m "(What's on my leg?)"
m "(A bug?)"
mo "On the exhale, the breath leaves your chest."
mo "Your ribs fall, and stomach contracts."
n "You take a peek down at your leg, and see nothing there."
n "You then peek up toward Belle, and see her in meditation, eyes closed."
m "(Huh, nothing.)"
m "(Must have been a bug...)"
mo "Continue with this breath, feeling all three parts of the breath."
mo "Think to yourself..."
mo "Stomach..."
n "You once again feel the sensation on your knee."
mo "Ribs..."
n "You feel the sensation move up your leg, again."
m "(What the hell is that?!)"
mo "Chest..."
n "The sensation quickly rushes up your leg and to your crotch."
m "*Muffled cough* (BELLE?! WHAT THE HELL?!)"
n "You quickly, but cautiously peek over at Belle..."
n "A huge, playful, grin is plastered across her face."
n "She winks at you, before making a \"shh\" sign with her hand..."
n "Before continuing to rub your crotch some more."
m "*Muffled choking* (What's she doing?!)"
m "(She'll get us both caught!)"
n "Despite your slight commotion, Eve continues the meditation."
mo "Breathe... Breathe... "
mo "Repeat this breath three times."
n "Belle continues stroking your crotch as the meditation continues..."
n "Making you rock hard."
m "(Ah fuck, she gave me a hard-on...)"
m "(I hope, for our sake, that Eve doesn't notice it...)"
mo "With your third exhale, begin to feel the breath..."
n "Belle keeps grabbing at your girthy member, with growing intensity."
mo "Feel the breath as a wave coming up from the stomach, and rising..."
m "(Shit, she's gonna make me...)"
mo "Hold this breath for two counts."
n "You grab Belle's hand, stopping its assault on your crotch."
b "(Aww, the fun's over?)"
mo "Now, exhale. "
n "As you exhale, you twinge with a slight pain from blue balls."
mo "Feel calmness in the breath."
n "You hold Belle's hand for a moment, before pushing it away."
m "(Wow, her hands are so soft.)"
b "(Oh, his grip is {i}strong...{/i})"
mo "Feel ease and steadiness."

m "Need a hand?"
b "(Giving me a hand after I gave you one?)"

mo "Follow me, you two."
m "(Relaxing back at the house, on the couch, sounds {i}pretty{/i} nice...)"
m "(I've barely had any time to chill on the couch since I got here.)"
n "You follow your desire to relax and head inside the house."
n "Once inside, you plop down onto the couch."
m "Aaaahhh..."
n "You reach for the remote and turn on the TV."
m "(I wonder if there's anything good on.)"
n "You flip through the channels..."
m "(Soap operas, news, reality shows...)"
m "(Doesn't seem like anything good is on.)"
n "Eventually, you give up and settle on a random channel."

k "Oh, hey [m!t]. How's it going?"
m "Hey, Kiara. Need any help?"
k "Oh, no no. It's fine. "

m "Hey, Kiara..."
k "Hey, [m!t]."
m "Can I ask you something?"
    k "Sure. What's up?"

                    k "I remember now. Did you ever find out who did it?"
                m "Yeah. Specifically, it was about that rope and mask."
                    k "Oh yeah. I told you that night, though. I don't know how that stuff got under my bed."

m "See you later, Kiara."

m "(Oh well, I'll get my answers later.)"
n "You get up off the couch and head to the girls' campground for lunch."
k "Sorry to leave you so soon, but I really have to go prep lunch."
m "Lunch?"

k "Nothing extravagant."

n "Eve is sitting on the couch, reading a book."
mo "Huh?"
mo "Oh. Hello, [m!t]."
mo "Got tired of using the front door?"
m "I realized this door gets neglected a lot."
m "So, I chose to take the {i}scenic route{/i}."
mo "I see."
mo "I too like to take the road less traveled."
mo "Anyway, how's your day going?"
m "Pretty good..."
m "Happy to not be doing constant chores for once."
mo "I'm glad you're enjoying your mostly-off day."
mo "You'll need that energy for the days to come."
n "You open the front door, and step inside the house."
n "Immediately, you notice Eve sitting on the couch, reading a book."
m "Hey, Eve."
mo "Hi, [m!t]. How's your day going?"
m "Pretty good..."
m "Happy to not be doing constant chores for once."
mo "I'm glad you're enjoying your mostly-off day."
mo "You'll need that energy for the days to come."
mo "Wanna join me on the couch?"
mo "Relax, maybe chat a little?"
m "Sure"
m "What's... up?"
m "Someone's relaxed."
mo "Well, because I have nothing to worry about."
m "(Fuck...)"
m "(If she knew what the girls have been doing...)"
m "That's good to hear, Eve."
n "Eve places her book on the coffee table, and turns to you."
mo "Well, aren't you going to sit down?"
m "Ah, if you insist."
mo "Come on, [m!t]. I don't bite."
mo "Take a load off."
n "You abide by Eve's request, and take a seat on the couch."
mo "So, how's your day been?"
mo "Hopefully you haven't been working too hard."
mo "*Chuckle* Or, working too little?"
m "I mean, I didn't have any tasks assigned to me."
mo "I'm just messing with you, don't worry."
m "You seem pretty relaxed today..."
m "Something nice happen?"
mo "Why, yes, actually."
mo "The nicest thing that {i}could{/i} happen."
mo "The patients' therapies are going smoothly."
m "Well, that's good to hear."
m "Do you think all of them will be cured?"
mo "Well, certain cases are more difficult than others to remedy..."
mo "But, yes. I think we will help them all."
m "That's great to hear."
    mo "So, how has college been?"
            mo "That's good to hear. Any classes giving you difficulties?"
                m "Not really. Things only get hard in the final year."
                    mo "You're right about that. I remember my first years of college fondly..."
                        m "Oh, yeah? Tell me a story from your \"glory days.\""
                            mo "Well, what kind of story do you want to hear?"
                                    mo "Oh, I don't know... My college days weren't very eventful."
                                        m "You sure? You've gotta have some good stories."
                        m "Were your classmates dinosaurs, by any chance?"
                            mo "Oooooh... Very original. No, I'm not that old..."
                                    mo "Good to see some self-awareness..."
                                        m "*Chuckle* You know that's not my strong suit."
                                        m "*Quietly* You'd benefit from a healthy dose of that, too..."
                    mo "Which class?"
                            mo "Oh, come on. You can't be serious..."
                                    mo "Really? Even after all those summers hearing my \"free lectures?\""
                                        m "You know, I didn't really get all that psycho-babble."
                                        m "I guess it all just went in one ear and out the other."
                                    mo "*Soft chuckle* You're quite the comedian."
                                            mo "What's so difficult about it?"
                                                m "There are just so many formulas you need to memorize..."
                                                m "Well, one tiny mistake becomes a huge error on a test..."
                        m "Well... Math was always my weakest subject."
                            mo "Where do you struggle with math?"
                                m "One mistake has a snowball effect in multipart problems..."
            mo "Ups and downs?"
                    mo "That's great to hear! Care to share?"
                        m "I always feel amazing after getting 90%% or more on exams."
                            mo "Of course, that's something to be proud of."
                        m "Yeah, I've spent time with two really great girls..."
                            mo "*Chuckle* Woah, there! You're quite the player, huh?"
                                m "*Chuckle* I didn't mean at the same time, Eve."
                    mo "Sorry to hear that... You want to talk about it?"
                        m "Sure... Recently, Jane and I ended whatever we had going..."
                            mo "Well, that's a shame... What caused it?"
                                m "She thought there was a rift forming between us..."
    mo "I swear, if you tell anyone what I tell you..."
    m "I won't tell a soul."
    mo "I'll hold you to that."
    mo "Well, okay. Here it goes..."
    mo "When I was in college, I joined a sorority..."
    mo "It wasn't one of those sororities you see in the movies."
    mo "I was quite timid, even a bit of a bookworm, back then."
    mo "Our sorority house was kind of... unusual."
    mo "Something in between a study group and a party house."
    m "(Party nerds?)"
    mo "I know what you're thinking."
    mo "\"Sounds boring.\""
    m "Well, no--"
    mo "I wouldn't disagree with you, but the parties some of our girls threw..."
    mo "Well, when they happened, they were the talk of the campus."
    m "I'm listening..."
    mo "Hmm... Okay. I know the perfect party to tell you about."
    mo "It was a pretty hot autumn, and getting close to Halloween..."
    mo "We were just about finished with our midterms..."
    mo "And, so eager to let our hair down a little."
    mo "So, we decided to organize a party at our house."
    mo "We decorated the place to look like an old Victorian manor..."
    m "Sounds spooky."
    mo "Oh, it was."
    mo "The cherry on top involved the old stone pond in the back yard..."
    m "A pond?"
    mo "I'll get to that..."
    m "Okay, okay."
    mo "So, we had our friends pass our fliers, and spread the word..."
    mo "By nightfall, tons of people were congregating on the front lawn."
    mo "We started letting them in, and within an hour the house was full."
    mo "The music was loud, the drinks flowing..."
    m "(Sounds like a bumpin' party.)"
    mo "As the night went on, the perfect time was approaching..."
    mo "One of my housemates got the partygoers' attention..."
    mo "And, that was our cue."
    mo "A few housemates and I threw these huge blocks of dry ice into the pond."
    mo "Which, in turn, released the spookiest-looking fog."
    mo "The girls went wild."
    mo "Within moments they were jumping into the pond, splashing around..."
    m "(Damn, that sounds like a Halloween party at the Playboy mansion...)"
    mo "We lost control of the partygoers. They got pretty rowdy..."
    mo "The party was shut down around 3am..."
    mo "Ah... What a night."
    m "(Looks like Eve has a wild side.)"
    mo "My most difficult class..."
    mo "Hmm..."
    mo "You know, I'd probably have to say neurobiology."
    mo "(Neurobiology? And, I thought math was hard...)"
    mo "Yeah, it's definitely neurobiology."
    mo "There was this one term I was studying like a maniac..."
    mo "All for this one final exam."
    m "Neurobiology?"
    mo "Yeah. The teacher was an old codger..."
    mo "Nearly blind, and very... {i}traditional{/i}."
    m "Was he teaching during The Renaissance?"
    mo "*Chuckle* You know? He might have."
    mo "Anyway... He wanted us to practically memorize the entire textbook..."
    mo "All the terminology, all the theories and systems..."
    mo "By the second week of studying, I was truly losing my marbles."
    mo "I hadn't slept in 3 days, and barely eaten much food..."
    mo "I was a machine built to study, and fueled by that sweet black liquid..."
    m "Coffee."
    mo "Exactly. I was a machine and coffee was my fuel."
    mo "So, finally the day came..."
    mo "I sat down, looked around at all the other panicked students."
    mo "The old man showed up, passed out the exams, and smiled..."
    m "(What an ass...)"
    mo "He got some sick joy in failing students."
    mo "And, the look of abject terror on the young faces in front of him."
    mo "There are some professors out there that make that their goal..."
    mo "I, personally, see that as a sign of that professor's failure."
    mo "Back to the point..."
    mo "I focused, filled in the exam to the best of my abilities, and turned it in."
    m "And?"
    mo "And, I ended up getting a 95 %% and rubbing it in his face, subtlely."
    m "Nice!"
    m "That's one of the best ways to stick it to a teacher like that."
    mo "Yeah. Yeah, it is..."
    mo "I'm sorry to hear that, [m!t]..."
    mo "I can sympathize with you."
    mo "I've had my fair share of heartbreak throughout my life..."
    m "Yeah?"
    mo "Yeah."
    mo "It gets better. Just give it time."
    m "Thanks, Eve..."
    n "Eve looks annoyed by your rude comment."
    mo "And here I thought you had matured..."
    mo "You still have some work to do."
    n "You roll your eyes at Eve, and both of you go quiet."
    mo "A young Casanova, you say?"
    mo "(I hope he's not trying anything with the patients...)"
    m "It's just something a friend of mine called me."
    mo "But, why would he call you that?"
    mo "Don't you know what that means, ladykiller?"
    m "Oh, that's what it means?"
    m "I thought they made that phrase up."
    mo "Of course they didn't..."
    mo "That phrase refers to to Giovanni Giacomo."
    mo "A figure from history often portrayed as a womanizer."
    m "*Chuckle* Oh, I'm definitely not that."
    mo "(Yeah, I really hope you aren't...)"
    mo "Well, your friend must have been calling you that ironically, then."
    m "People {i}do{/i} love to make me the butt of jokes."
    mo "I won't push it..."
    mo "Whatever it is, though... I'm sorry it happened."
    m "Thanks, Eve."
    mo "I'm here for you, [m!t]."
    m "I really appreciate it."
n "Suddenly, you both hear the beeping noise of a phone alarm..."
n "Which interrupts the conversation you were having with Eve."
mo "Oh, would you look at the time."
mo "Sorry, [m!t]. Looks like our time is up."
m "(Now I feel like one of her patients...)"
m "(Talking with a deadline.)"
m "It's fine. What's the alarm for?"
mo "It's a little head's-up that we need to start preparing the barbecue."
m "You're probably going to need my help, huh?"
mo "*Chuckle* How'd you know, Mr. Chef?"
m "I'm going to be the grillmaster?"
mo "Yes you are."
m "Cool."
mo "Anyway, let's go."
mo "Kiara should be meeting us in the kitchen, shortly."
n "You follow Eve the short distance into the kitchen."
n "Deciding to follow Stacy, you jog after her, down the path."
m "Hey, Stacy!"
m "Wait up!"
n "You quickly catch up to Stacy, who greets you with a happy smile."
s "Hello, [m!t]."
s "What are you doing running after me?"
m "I saw you down the path, and decided to see what you're up to."
s "Oh, you want to spend time with me?"
m "Maybe..."
m "My main thought {i}was{/i} just to say hello."
m "You may change my mind, though."
s "I enjoy the time we spend together."
s "And, well..."
mo "Hello, Violet."
mo "How are you today?"
v "Hi, Dr. Eve. I'm doing well, thank you."
v "How are you?"
mo "I'm fine, thanks for asking."
mo "Well, Violet..."
mo "You know that your situation is far more... sensitive."
v "Yes... I know."
mo "Because of this, the kinds of therapies available to you are limited."
v "Oh..."
mo "Don't be disheartened, Violet."
mo "I'll do my best to help you."
mo "In fact, I think I have an idea what might help..."
v "That's wonderful."
mo "However, it will take your complete cooperation."
m "(Complete cooperation?)"
mo "Despite how odd it may be to you, at first."
v "Odd?"
mo "Well, not exactly {i}odd.{/i}"
mo "Rather, something you may not be used to."
v "Okay, I'll give you my complete cooperation."
mo "Excellent. Then, we can begin..."
mo "Today, you will only go through a preliminary hypnotherapy session."
mo "We want to ease you into it, so there are no adverse side-effects."
v "Side-effects?"
mo "You really don't need to worry about them."
m "(I wonder what those side-effects are...)"
mo "We'll take this slowly, to properly {i}acclimate{/i} your mind, so to speak."
v "Okay, I trust you."
v "I have been feeling better since arriving here..."
mo "You have quite a journey still."
v "I know. I'm ready to conquer this challenge."
n "You reposition yourself underneath the window..."
n "A spot where you have a better vantage point."
m "(I can see them fine, from here.)"
m "(Not the best, but better than my last angle.)"
n "As you peer through the window once more... "
n "...you see Eve take something out of her pocket."
m "(What's that?)"
mo "This is a simple pendulum."
mo "I'll need you to focus on it as it swings."
mo "And, listen to me very carefully."
v "Okay..."
m "(She's doing hypnotherapy on Violet?)"
m "(This is gonna be interesting...)"
mo "In a moment, I am going to ease you into relaxation."
n "Eve begins swinging the pendulum as she speaks more calmly."
mo "Follow the pendulum with your eyes, and listen to my voice."
mo "I am going to count down from ten, to one."
v "Okay..."
mo "The moment I say the number ten, you will let your eyelids grow heavy..."
mo "...allowing them to close, and remain closed."
v "Yes..."
mo "The moment I say the number ten..."
mo "...you will, in your mind, see yourself atop a set of stairs."
mo "The moment I say the number nine, and every other number counting down..."
mo "You will move down those stairs, relaxing more with each step."
v "Mhm..."
mo "At the bottom of the stairs is a large, comfortable bed."
mo "A bed with silky sheets, and feathered pillows."
v "Sounds pleasant..."
mo "The moment I say the number one..."
mo "...you will sink into the bed, and rest your head on the soft pillow."
mo "Follow the pendulum..."
mo "Starting with ten... Let your eyes grow heavy..."
mo "Ten... Your eyes grow heavier."
mo "Nine... You're relaxing, and letting go."
mo "Eight... Sink into a more comfortable position."
mo "Seven..."
mo "Six... Another step..."
mo "Five... You're calm, and relaxing more."
mo "Four..."
mo "Three... Breathe in slowly."
mo "Two... You're nearly at the luxurious bed..."
mo "One... "
mo "Let yourself sink into the comfortable bed..."
mo "Let every muscle go limp and loose, as you sink into calmness."
mo "Good, gooood..."
n "Eve puts the pendulum down, before speaking once more."
mo "How do you feel, Violet?"
v "I feel... Relaxed."
mo "That's great."
mo "Listen to my voice..."
v "I am listening to your voice."
mo "Good."
mo "Now that you're relaxed, I am going to give you affirmations..."
m "(Hmm? Affirmations?)"
mo "...and, you will embrace them fully."
v "I will embrace them fully."
m "(Woah, okay... This is getting interesting.)"
mo "First, we will begin with simple affirmations..."
mo "These will modify your behavior..."
mo "Both conscious and subconscious."
m "(What the hell is Eve doing?)"
m "(This sounds like some MK ULTRA shit...)"
mo "You are relaxed."
v "I am relaxed."
mo "You are emerging..."
v "I am emerging..."
m "(Emerging?)"
mo "...from your shell."
v "...from my shell."
m "(This is so weird...)"
mo "You are comfortable at Red Falls."
v "I am comfortable at Red Falls."
mo "You are comfortable with the other girls."
v "I am comfortable with the other girls."
m "(She's suggesting for Violet to become more... open?)"
mo "You are comfortable with your body."
v "I am comfotable with my body."
mo "You are not triggered by clapping, anymore."
v "I am not triggered by clapping, anymore."
m "(Oh...)"
m "(I think I see where Eve is taking this...)"
mo "Now, Violet... I'm going to test something..."
v "Now... Violet... I'm going to--"
m "(Heh, this is actually kinda funny.)"
mo "No, no. Please don't repeat this."
v "Okay."
n "Eve slowly raises her hands in front of herself..."
n "Looking concerned, and acting cautiously, Eve claps twice."
m "(Uh-oh...)"
v "Mmmff... Ahh..."
m "(Eve just made Violet... cum!)"
m "(What the hell?!)"
mo "*Quietly* Damn. I hoped that would help..."
mo "You are calm. You are relaxed."
v "I am... calm. I'm... relaxed."
mo "I will count up to three..."
mo "On three... You will come back to us, and open your eyes."
v "I will come back..."
mo "One..."
mo "Two..."
mo "Three."
n "Violet opens her eyes, as Eve says three."
mo "Welcome back, Violet."
mo "How do you feel?"
v "I... uhh..."
v "I feel a bit weird... "
v "But... also really relaxed."
m "(This was the most bizarre session yet...)"
m "(I think I've seen {i}too much.{/i})"
n "As you crouch to sneak away..."
n "You hear someone whisper in your ear."
s "*Whisper* What are you dooooing?"
m "*Quiet gasp* Aah. Uh, hey Stacy."
n "Attempting to divert attion from what you were doing..."
n "You bear hug Stacy, pulling her away from the window."
m "I'm so happy to see you!"
s "I am pleased to see you too, [m!t]."
m "(That was pretty smooth...)"
m "(But, I'm probably not out of the woods yet.)"
n "You put your arm over Stacy's shoulder and walk her to the front of the house."
    s "What were you doing over there?"
            s "Are you... watching Violet?"
                    s "Oh? For tribute?"

            s "Oh? You wish to pay tribute to the divine flame?"
                    s "I'm certain you will succeed. Do you require help?"
                            s "The ashen kings? One does not pay tribute to them..."
                m "Yeah, I just wanted to get closer to the ashy kings."
                    s "The ashy kings? One does not pay tribute to them..."
                        m "Ah, you're right. I misspoke. I meant the flame... of creation."
n "Stacy scowls at you suspiciously..."
s "I feel as though..."
s "You're being deceitful."
m "I swear, I'm telling you the truth."
s "(The flame never lies...)"
s "I am disheartened by your actions... [m!t]."
s "It will take some time for the flame to forgive your dishonesty."
m "(Shit, I didn't convince her...)"
m "I'm sorry, Stacy..."
s "I must leave you, now."
s "See you at the barbecue."
n "Without actually saying goodbye, Stacy walks away sullenly."
s "(Why was he... watching her?)"
s "(What does he think of her...)"
s "(Heavenly... please guide me...)"
m "(She may burn me alive in my sleep for this...)"
m "*Shudder*"
n "Realizing you messed up, you walk over to the front steps."
n "Sitting on the front steps of the house, you collect your thoughts."
m "(I hope she'll forgive me...)"
n "However, you are interrupted by Violet walking toward you."
v "Hey, [m!t]! What's wrong?"
m "Oh, nothing. I'm just feeling a bit tired..."
v "That's too bad. It's such a nice day!"
v "We have a little free time before the barbecue..."
v "I might take a dip in the lake. It's pretty refreshing."
v "If you're feeling up for it, you could join me?"
m "Huh? Oh... no, I can't."
m "I think I'm needed here."
v "(Oh, that's such a shame...)"
v "(Why am I feeling so... open?)"
v "See you later, then."
m "See you, Violet."
m "(Why was she being so open with me?)"
m "(She's usually so shy...)"
m "(Odd.)"
n "Violet walks away from you and down the path, energetically."
s "Aaahh..."
s "I am happy..."
m "Oh?"
s "I am happy to be here, with you."
s "You seem to respect my beliefs..."
s "I am not used to this."
s "At best... most people just mock us..."
s "At worst, they threaten us with violence..."
s "...sometimes acting on their violent impulses."
m "I'm sorry to hear that, Stacy..."
n "Stacy becomes more cheerful, in an attempt to ease your mind."
s "Oh, do not worry. We are strong in body and spirit."
m "(You sure are...)"
n "You walk with Stacy to the front of the house."
s "[m!ct]... I have an idea."
s "Will you hear me out?"
m "Sure, Stacy."
s "I would like to spend more time with you."
s "We still have some free time before the barbecue this evening, you know?"
m "(I wonder where this is going...)"
m "Yes?"
s "I would like you to come with me... somewhere."
m "Will you tell me where we're going?"
s "*Giggle* That would ruin half the fun."
s "Do you trust me?"
m "(That's a good question...)"
m "(Do I?)"
s "Well... Do you?"
m "I do, Stacy."
s "Good. Then, will you join me?"
m "(Hmm... Will I?)"
    m "(Hmm... Will I?)"

        m "Your secret place?"
        s "Yes. I found this place the first day I got here."

        m "I thought you needed fire for that."
        s "Oh, no. "

        m "Interesting..."
        s "There are other forms of connection..."
        s "...that allow divine communication."
        m "(Is she--)"
        n "Stacy comes closer to you, and embraces you."

        n "Then meet your lips."
        s "Touch me..."
        m "Okay."

mo "I think we'll wrap things up for tonight."
mo "Ladies, you can spend the time before bed however you'd like."
mo "I'd suggest a nighttime walk."
mo "Or, you can stargaze by the lake."
mo "There is a lot of beauty beneath the stars at this camp."
mo "You just need to search for it, sometimes."
mo "Have a good evening, ladies."
n "Hearing the good news, the girls happily head back to their campground."
mo "[m!ct], I need you to help with clean-up."
m "Sure. What do you need me to do?"
mo "Grab the tray and utensils we brought out earlier."

mo "I'll deal with the barbecue and meet you back at the house."
mo "See you soon."

m "(I'll just put these down here...)"

k "Why did I get stuck with trash duty?"

k "And, they're so far away from the house..."
em "We're lucky they are!"
m "Yeah, they'd make this place smell like a dump, otherwise."
k "Yeah, you're right. Better that they're all the way out there."
em "You put the trays--"

m "So, what do you guys wanna watch?"

em "Meh."
em "Nope."

k "Night-night, [m!t]."

n "You hear the girls' bedroom doors close, and pick up the remote."

m "(Eve's earlier suggestion to go on a nighttime walk sounds nice right now.)"
m "(Why not? Maybe I'll see something cool.)"
n "You get up from your spot on the couch, eager to go on your walk."
n "Quickly, you're out the front door."
m "(Ahhh. There's nothing quite like that fresh nighttime air.)"
n "Taking a deep breath, you begin slowly walking down the path."

n "For a moment everyone forgets their troubles, living only in that moment."
n "You and the girls pass the time counting shooting stars."
s "Ooh, another fire-tailed star!"
v "I think that's the fifth shooting star I've seen in the past half hour."
m "It's truly magical out here, huh?"
s "Mystical..."
n "More time passes until Naomi speaks up to announce her departure."
nao "It's been nice, but I'm heading off to bed."

m "Oh? Just a walk?"
b "Who knows what exciting things might happen unexpectedly?"
b "I just know you'll have a good time with me."
m "Oh, straight to the point?"
b "What? Nooo. I was just saying you love my company."

b "Well? What are you waiting for?"
    b "Well? What are you waiting for?"
