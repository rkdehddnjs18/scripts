    s "Nothing happened, that's the problem."

    s "She became so... Hungry..."
    m "And then the dildos started appearing?"

    s "I usually pride myself on how well I can control my urges..."
    s "But now, because of her and all that kinky stuff..."

    s "It's not enough!"
    m "One dildo's not enough?"
    s "Not that! I can pleasure myself, if need be, without one."
    m "So what's the problem?"

    m "What else is there to do?"
    s "Return the favor?"
    m "Oh..."
    s "[m!t], I feel bad... I wasn't using the dildo on her..."

    s "I know you're worried about your relationship with your girlfriend."
    s "You keep bringing it up all the time."
    s "But it's not cheating if you're helping a patient, right?"
    m "Yeah, that won't happen... (Maybe it'll be enough if I just watch or something...)"
    s "Fine, can we at least go somewhere private?"
    m "*Sigh* I guess we should find a secluded space."

    m "That's kinda the reason why I suspected you."
    k "We never {i}did{/i} talk about it, did we?"
    m "No, we didn't."
    k "So you thought I wanted to suck your dick again, and this was the only way I could have done it, so nobody found out?"
    k "{i}How sweet{/i}."
    m "It {i}kinda{/i} makes sense, doesn't it?"
    k "It {i}kinda{/i} does."
    m "So you would have done it, if you thought of it?"
    k "*Chuckle* I think I'd just ask you, like last time."
    k "While we're on the subject..."
    k "Since we never talked about it..."
    m "What is it?"
    k "Did you {i}enjoy{/i} it?"
    m "Being tied up and getting head?"
    k "No!"
    k "That other time..."
    k "{i}With me{/i}."
    m "Oh..."
    k "I'm sorry, it's a stupid question. You don't have to answer."
    m "No, no. It's fine. We should get it off our chests."
    m "If you must know, it was {i}really{/i} good."
    k "Awww, really?"
    m "Getting head from you? Hardly anything compares to that, Kiara."
    k "*Giggle* Stop it, I'll blush."
    m "Yeah, what a compliment."
    m "You asked me a weird question, now let me ask you one."
    k "Go ahead."
    m "Did {i}you enjoy{/i} it?"
    k "Did I..."
    k "*Chuckle* Yes. Yes, I did."
    k "And I think about it sometimes..."
    k "{i}Fondly{/i}."
    k "*Chuckle* And your massive dick."
    m "*Chuckle* Is it?"
    k "I mean, it seemed big at the time."
    k "It's not like I had a huge catalog of dicks to compare it with."
    k "Though..."
    m "\"Though\" {i}what{/i}?"
    k "Though... I wouldn't mind taking another look."
    m "You seriously wanna see my junk?"
    k "Not {i}junk{/i}. Your prized possession."
    m "*Chuckle* Stop pulling my leg."
    k "I'm not joking."
    m "Uhhh, I don't know what to say."
    k "You don't have to say {i}anything{/i}, just {i}show me{/i}."
    m "I don't know..."
    k "Come on, don't be such a bore."
    k "I'll tell you if it's as big as I remember."
    m "How can I say no to that..."
    k "Come ooon, don't tell me you're not at least a bit curious?"
    m "I mean, I guess I am."
    k "So take it out, then."
    m "Hmm... (I don't know about this. It's a bit awkward.)"
    m "(Then again, after all these years, Kiara and I are finally talking about it.)"
    m "(Maybe it's for the best if I show her my dick and be done with it.)"
    m "(Like, \"healing old wounds\" or \"making peace\" or something.)"
    m "Alright, fuck it."
    k "You're gonna do it?"
    m "But under one condition."
    k "Name it?"
    m "Show me your boobs."
    k "What, why?"
    m "Quid pro quo."
    m "Plus, I always thought you had a nice pair."
    k "Look at you, what a charming creep..."
    m "Hey, you went there first."
    k "Hmm, alright. Since you said they were nice..."
    k "But {i}you{/i} do it first."
    m "Watch me."
    n "Kiara sits up straight, intently eyeing what's about to happen, as you lean back onto the bed and start unbuckling your pants."
    k "*Chuckle* Can't believe you're doing this. (I'm actually going to see his dick again!)"
    m "Me neither, but what the hell."
    m "{i}You ready{/i}?"
    k "Did it just get hotter in here?"
    m "Kiara..."
    k "I'm just nervous... but I wanna see it."
    m "Well, then..."
    m "Enjoy it."
    n "As you whip out your cock, Kiara's eyes widen with surprise."
    m "Like what you see?"
    k "Well... Can't say I don't."
    k "You're lucky you have such a nice cock."
    m "Compliments will only get you so far..."
    m "{i}Show me{/i}."
    k "Aren't we eager?"
    n "Kiara gingerly grabs her towel with both hands. Casting sly looks as she does."
    n "Before revealing what she's got hiding underneath."
    m "Oh... Wow."
    k "*Chuckle*"
    n "You scan every inch of her soft-looking hills with your gaze."
    n "Unable to move your eyes away from them."
    n "And Kiara, being the one in question, only furthered the kinkiness of it all."
    n "And it showed."
    k "Well..."
    k "I wanted to ask what you thought of them, but it seems I already got my answer."
    n "Looking back down, you notice your hand instinctively going up and down your now erect cock."
    m "Shit, sorry! I didn't mean..."
    k "*Laughs* Why are you apologizing?"
    m "My hand just started moving..."
    k "I'll take it as a compliment."
    k "But if you wanna blast one out, I don't mind."
    m "You know I won't do that."
    k "Pity..."
    k "What if I did it for you?"
    m "What!?"
    n "Kiara leans towards you, nearly prowling as she does."
    n "Purring on her way to your crotch."
    n "Without warning, she grabs it."
    m "Hey, stop it!"
    k "I had to see for myself."
    m "You SAW, this is TOUCHING. Know the difference!"
    k "Shut up, you know what I mean."
    n "For another moment, Kiara keeps studying your cock intently."
    k "It's really thick, actually."
    k "I don't think I could swallow as much as last time."
    m "Kiara, let go of it."
    k "I wonder if it'll get bigger if I do this."
    n "Suddenly, Kiara's hand starts pulling on your shaft."
    m "W-What are you... Aren't we going too far!?(She's jerking me off!)"
    k "Depends who you ask."
    m "Ahh... Fuck... (She's so close. I can feel her warmth on me...)"
    k "Feels good, huh?"
    m "(Her warm breath on my cock when she speaks...)"
    k "You know [m!t], you were right about one thing at least..."
    m "And what's that?"
    k "I always wanted to do it again."
    n "Before you can speak up, Kiara envelops your cock with her lips."
    n "Then slowly starts sliding down your shaft."
    m "Wai-Ahhh! (Kiara's sucking my dick!)"
    m "*Moan* (She's still going!)"
    m "Wow... (Taking it deep!)"
    n "Having your dick in Kiara's mouth feels wonderful."
    n "Wonderful, pleasurable and {i}guilty{/i}."
    n "As Kiara's tongue flicks and twirls around your cock, you almost forget about Jane."
    m "Fuck... Kiara... (It feels so good... and I want her to continue, but I can't. We shouldn't!)"
    k "*Gasp*"
    k "I think I could fit it all in, with a bit of practice."
    m "Are you..."
    k "Mmm, it's so nice and big. You're really lucky, you know?"
    k "I'm also lucky as well, having you like this..."
    m "(Can't say I'm not enjoying the craziness of it all, but this doesn't feel right.)"
    n "Before you can say anything, Kiara speaks up - still compulsively stroking your cock."
    k "You know, I could just suck you off to completion."
    k "I'd like that {i}very much{/i}."
    n "This whole day ended up as an uncontrollable mess."
    n "Everything was moving so fast, it was hard to keep up."
    n "Feeling nervous and overwhelmed, you do the only thing you can."
    m "I-I can't do this."
    k "You're getting cold feet {i}now{/i}!?"
    m "It's wrong, god-damn it!"
    k "[m!t], come on..."
    n "Leaving Kiara's room in a hurry, you don't reply."
    n "You had nothing more to say to her."
    m "Jesus Christ... Why is this happening to me? (This is crazy, how could I let this happen!)"
    n "Unexpectedly, you notice Emily walking up the stairs."
    n "As if in pain, she was massaging her jaw."
    n "Immediately dropping her arm the moment she saw you."
    m "(What's wrong with her jaw? She looks spooked again...)"
    m "(And what's with her legs? They're red and bruised...)"
    em "EEEK!"
    em "[m!t]... *Pant* You scared me."
    m "(She gets spooked every time she sees me?)"
    em "[m!t], umm, hi. What's up?"
    em "I'm stretching my facial muscles, so I can give you a bigger smile when I see you."
    m "(A sore jaw...)"
    m "(Along with red knees?)"
    m "No... (Don't tell me...)"
    m "(No, no, no, it couldn't have.)"
    em "W-What's wrong, [m!t]?"
    m "IT WAS YOU!!!"
