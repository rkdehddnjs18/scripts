n Still hesitant, you make your way towards the house.
m (So many memories here...)
m (Bad ones... But I can't lie... Some good ones too.)
m (Do I knock? Or just go in?)
m (Maybe it would be better if...)
n Suddenly, the door bursts open.
em [m!t]!
m Hi...
n She jumps you, almost making you lose your balance.
em Oh, how I missed you!
m Missed you too, Em...
em Awww!
n A few seconds pass while neither of you says anything.
m Would you mind climbing down now?
em Nope, not yet!
n You did have your reason for asking...
n Emily's breasts were pressed hard against your chest.
m You've really grown.
em I did?
m Yeah, and you're heavy.
n Hearing this, she gets off.
em Hey! That's no way to talk to a lady.
m Oh? So now you're a lady?
em Yeah... Not really...
em Never mind. Come in!
n For a split second, you hesitate...
n But Emily grabs your hand.
n And pulls you inside.
em Aaaand...
m And?
em How's college?
m Oh. Good, I guess...
em Must be better than good, since you haven't shown your face around here in a while.
m You see, I...
k Look what the cat dragged in.
m Hi, Kiara.
k Hey.
tut This game features something called \"x-ray\".
tut Use your cursor to highlight and press the left mouse button in the upper left corner.
tut This will enter an \"x-ray mode\". You can leave it by pressing anywhere on the screen.
tut Try it yourself.
m Didn't know you're back at camp.
k Didn't think I would be.
k Anyway, nice to see you, [m!t].
m You too.
k We'll talk later. Gotta go prepare the cabins.
m Sure.
m (Not even a hug... Well, that's kind of to be expected, since...)
n Something else grabs your attention.
em Anyone at college catch your eye?
m Huh?
em College? Hot girls?
m Hahaha, sure... There are some hot ones out there.
m But, I'm kinda seeing someone.
em You are?! Who?!
em What's her name?!
em How old is she?!
em Are you taking classes together?!
em Is she hot?
em Do you have a picture of her?!
em What am I even talking about? Of course you do!
em Why haven’t you already shown me?!
m Could I unpack first?
em Right... Silly me.
em Sorry, I just get so excited!
m Some things never change, I guess. (Still, she did grow up so much.)
em Guess not. *Giggle*
em Oh right, that reminds me!
em Eve said you should unpack once you arrive and she'll come and find you.
em Here's the key to your room.
em You better get going. So we still have time to hang out afterwards.
m Sounds good to me!
tut This game features navigation.
tut Use your cursor to highlight interactable objects like doors, items or characters.
tut To interact with them, simply press the left mouse button.
tut The game also has a HINT system. If you get stuck, click on question mark in the upper right corner to see what you need to do next.
tut To use the map during free roam mode, click on the compass icon below the other icons in the sidebar on the right side of the screen.
tut Upon clicking the compass icon, the map of your current location will appear on the screen.
m Where did I put the key?
            m Oh! Here it is!
            m Hmm, I can’t find it. Maybe if I–
            m Oh, it’s unlocked!
n As you open the door...
n An overwhelming sense of nostalgia washes over you.
m Heh...(It's still the same.)
m (So many memories...)
m (It almost feels good being back.)
m (Almost...)
m Jane?
n You open the message. Only to find a hot, nude selfie from Jane.
j *Still in bed. Wish you were here.*
m *Damn! Girl! You need to warn me before sending something like this.
j *I do?*
m *Yes.*
j *Okay. Warning!*
n As any man would, you start the video...
n Immediately, you feel your pants tighten.
n Though, as luck would have it...
n The door suddenly opens.
mo I heard you were back home!
mo But I had to see for myself.
n As fast as you can, you put down the phone.
m Hi, Eve.(Shit!)
mo Stand up, silly! Give me a hug!
n You stand up to give her a hug
n She comes in to hug you, but you try your best she doesn’t feel your crotch.
mo It's good to see you, [m!t].
mo So good to see you.
m Yeah, good to see you too, Eve.
mo Oh, how you've grown.
m Yeah... You too, Eve.
mo Ha-ha. Still funny as always.
m *Chuckle* You know me.
mo Oh, how I missed you!
n Without giving you a chance to react, she hugs you... Hard.
n As she presses against you, she feels your bulge.
mo Oh! I see you've grown in other places too?
mo *Chuckle* Happy to see me?
n Instantly, you pull away.
m Eve!
mo What? I'm just joking.
m I know, but still...(She's always been like this.)
m (Not sure why she gets such a kick out of messing with me like this...)
mo Hahaha! You were always so cute when embarrassed.
mo Although, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
m Yeah... Yeah... I know the talk. \"It's normal at my age\"... Blah, blah, blah...
mo I wasn't talking about that... I was talking about the size.
m Eve! (She seriously doesn't know how to let it go.)
mo Hahahah! Just joking! Calm down.
mo Jeez! Since when did you get so {i}\"stiff\"{/i}?
m Will you stop it?!
mo *Chuckle* Okay, okay. I'll stop.
m *Sigh* Thank you.
mo No, thank you for letting me feel it.
m HEY! You said you'll stop. (Not sure why I even believed her...)
mo That was the last one. I promise.
m Good.
mo This is the best thing to do in awkward situations like this.
n Knowing what follows, you sit on the bed...
mo If we didn't make a joke out of it, you would've been thinking whether I felt it or not.
mo And I would've been thinking, \"Why does [m!t] have an erection?\"
mo That means we'd both be thinking about your... Ahmm... And that's {i}a lot{/i} more awkward.
mo It would leave a scar on your young, impressionable brain.
mo Not a big one, but... For the next couple of days, you would be thinking, \"Did Eve feel my erection?\"
mo It would go through your head every time you saw me. You'd be confused, even worried, about it.
mo This way...
m Eve, stop it.
m I get it!
m You don't need to over-analyze me, or this situation.
mo Oh, right! Sorry! Work habit...
m I know.
mo Thank you for coming on such short notice.
m It's okay.
mo I know I probably ruined your summer...
mo But, I really needed you here.
m So, what's going on?
mo As I mentioned on the phone, things are going to be different this year.
m What \"things\"?
mo The patients.
m What, you're no longer taking in fappers and bullies?
mo No, we graduated to serial killers.
m WHAT?!
mo *Chuckles* I'm joking, [m!t].
m That wasn't really funny.
mo *Chuckle* Best I let you unpack.
mo We can talk more during dinner.
m Sure.
mo Okay. I need to get back to work, anyway.
mo See you later.
m Later, Eve.
n As she leaves, you turn towards your luggage...
tut Panties are a form of collectable item scattered across the camp in various locations. Some are easier to spot...
tut while others will be hidden away in hard to see places.
tut Collecting panties will unlock special images in the gallery, so keep your eyes open for them in each scene!
m (I should finally unpack.)
m (And I gotta make sure not to forget about Jane's text...)
n Around 20 minutes later...
m (All done. Now to help Kiara finish setting up.)
hint Go to the camp area.
m Need help?
k I'm doing the last cabin.
m So, yes or no?
k Sure, why not.
m Say...
k Huh?
m Eve mentioned something...
k What?
m That she's taking in different patients this time around?
m You know anything about that?
k Hmmm, she didn't tell me anything.
m Nothing?
k Nope. She's probably screwing with you.
k It's always the same guys since my first year here.
k Delinquent boys and wannabe bad-asses.
m So... Your type, right?
k *Chuckle* Maybe...
m You always loved it when they arrived.
m Me, on the other hand...
k So what if they didn't like you?
k Can you blame them?
k They were jealous.
m So that's why they screwed with me?
k Umm, I guess...
k It wasn't so bad...
m Maybe for you! The \"hot girl\" in camp no one could touch.
k Hmm, that {i}is{/i} true, but...
m They're the reason I hate this place from the bottom of my soul.
k No, you don't...
m Wanna bet?
k How about you just help me clean this cabin?
m Yay... Making beds for animals. Wooo-hoo...
    n Still unhappy, you decide to help her...
    n Still unhappy, you help her, and about twenty minutes later...
k Pheew! That should be it!
m Yeah...
n With the cabin prepared, you two walk out.
m *Sigh* Fuck this...
k You aren't a kid anymore.
k You can hold your ground now.
m You don't need to tell me that.
k Then why are you bitching about it all the time?
m Damn. Ice-cold...
k You really don't wanna be here, huh?
m Yeah, I really don't.
k This year won't be so bad.
k I have a feeling the guys will be nice.
m I bet you do. (Nice and hot, maybe...)
k You trying to say something?
m Nope.
k You sure about that?
m Positive.
k Oh, shit...
m What is it?
k I forgot The Guidelines in the house.
m I'll go get them.
k Don't forget, you need to put two in each cabin.
m I remember, Kiara.
k *Chuckle* Sorry for doubting you.
k Anyway, I think I left them on the kitchen table.
m Got it.
hint Get the guidelines from the kitchen table.
m Here they are.
em Hey, [m!t]!
m Huh?
em Wanna go for a swim?
m Oh, umm... I have to--
em Come on! It's such a nice day!
m I have to get these--
em Oh, come on...
em Pretty please? I wanna try on my new bikini!
m I can't right--
em Trust me, you need a swim after such a long trip. *Giggle*
m *Sigh* Fine, let's go for a swim. (The lake {i}did{/i} look refreshing.)
em Yaaay!
m But, just a quick dip.
em Sure.
m Let me go get my trunks.
em Hurry up.
m Yeah, yeah.
n Going upstairs, you rummage through your stuff and pull out your trunks.
n Putting them on, you rush back downstairs...
em Ready?
m Yeah, let's go.
em Weee!
n Together, you make your way towards the lake.
em Hey! Kiara's here too!
m (Is she now?)
em Kiara! Put on some clothes!
m (Topless?!)
em Show off!
em Come on, [m!t], let's go.
n You and Emily make your way towards the small dock.
k What are you two doing here?
em Going for a swim.
em What are {i}you{/i} doing topless?
k Getting a tan.
m Makes sense.
em Maybe you should be a bit more careful?
k What do you care, you little brat.
em UGH!!! I told you not to call me that!
em I'm not a kid anymore! I'm nineteen!
k Not being a kid doesn't mean you're not still a brat.
em UGHH!!!
m How about we all calm down a little, huh?
k I {i}am{/i} calm.
n Saying this, Kiara lies back down on her stomach.
em Hmph!
n Not feeling the need to intervene anymore, you start running...
n And jump into the lake.
m Ahhh... So refreshing!
m Come on, Emily!
em Here I come!
n She starts running...
n Jumps...
n And makes the biggest splash she can.
k Ahhh!
em Oooh! It's cold! Why didn't you warn me?!
k What the fuck, Emily?!
n In her fit of rage, Kiara forgets she's topless.
m *Gulp*
em Sorry!
k Oh?! (Shit! I'm topless!)
n Immediately, she lies back down.
em Won't happen again!
k Yeah, yeah, whatever... (I should be more careful.)
m *Whispers* You did that on purpose, didn't you?
em *Whispers* Maybe. *Giggle*
em Brrr! This is too cold for me, I'm getting out.
m What are you talking about? It's perfect.
em Yeah, maybe for you.
m Booo, party pooper...
n Ignoring you, Emily swims towards the shore...
n And gets out of the water as soon as she can.
n Unbeknownst to her, the new bikini she bought becomes a bit see-through when wet.
em Brrrr...
n Her nipples, also, got hard from the icy water.
n Combined with a slightly transparent bikini...
n It's a view you're not very comfortable seeing.
em How can you stay in there?
m It's not so bad. (Oh, fuck... Am I getting hard?)
m I'm going for a swim. (Gotta get this picture out of my head.)
em You're crazy!
m Probably...
n Trying to {i}\"cool off\"{/i}, you start swimming.
m (What's wrong with me?!)
m (I got hard by looking Emily's tits?)
m (And I'm still hard?! What the...)
m (I mean, it's a normal, physical reaction, right? Right?!)
m (Just my male brain. It sees boobs and the brain sends a signal...)
m (Apparently, it doesn't matter whose.)
m (I mean, what do you expect?)
m (First I see Kiara topless...)
m (And then Emily with that see-through bikini...)
m (Fuck, [m!t]! Get it out of your head!)
n (Still not calm enough, you decide to swim a bit longer.)
n And a few minutes later...
n Finally, you swim up to the dock.
em *Giggle* Your balls freeze off yet?
m Nah. You coming back in?
em Not a chance.
m Weren't you the one who wanted to go swimming?
em Umm... No, I don't recall saying that. *Giggle*
m Kiara? What about you?
k I'm good.
m Oh, come on. The water's great, don't listen to Emily.
k The weather channel said the next five days will be extremely hot...
k Maybe in a day or two, when the water gets a bit warmer.
k Besides, I don't even have my swimsuit here.
m Fine, fine...
em Say... [m!t]?
m Yeah?
em You still haven't told me anything about this girl you're seeing.
k Oh? So you {i}are{/i} seeing someone?
em What's her name?
m Jane.
em Is she hot?
m Yeah...
em Hotter than {i}me{/i}?
m Yes.
em You suuure?
n You break eye contact as your eyes instinctively move downwards.
n Unable to speak due to the sight you're witnessing...
n You simply dive underwater.
m (Did she... Do that on purpose?)
m (Is she not aware that her bikini is see-through?!)
m (Probably not... Yeah, there's no way she did that on purpose.)
m (Shit, I got hard again... Fuck my brain.)
m (Ughh... I need air!)
n Gasping for air, you pop out of the water.
em *Pout* You didn't even think about it for a second. Just immediately said yes.
m Umm....
k Emily.
em What?!
m *Gulp*
k You {i}do{/i} know that bikini of yours is see-through when it gets wet?
n Confused, Emily looks down...
em So? Who cares?
em I'm not {i}\"hot\"{/i}, anyway.
n Looking {i}pretty{/i} pissed, she storms off.
k Like I said... Brat.
k By the way, you should get out of there before you catch a cold.
m I'll just stay in here a little longer, don't worry.
k Oh? Yeah, sure. (Hmm, I have a hunch about what's going on...)
m Like I said, it's not that cold.
k Whatever you say. (I think we both know why you can't get out.)
k I'll leave you to it then...
k I'm going inside. Don't wanna get a sunburn.
m Oh, okay.
n Making sure to cover her boobs, Kiara starts getting up.
n Carefully, she turns around...
n Puts on her shirt...
n And walks away.
n As she leaves, you get to the pier.
m (I better wait a minute or two, until it goes down again... Just to be safe.)
n And, a minute or two later, you get out of the lake.
n Taking the towel Kiara left, you dry yourself off.
m (It felt a little weird wiping myself down with a towel she had under her--)
m (No, no more thinking about shit like that.)
m (Anyway, why did Emily just run away?)
m Hmm... (Is she {i}that{/i} insecure about her looks?)
m (Well, probably... She's only nineteen and still pretty impressionable...)
m (I should go talk to her, maybe apologize.)
m (Damn, it's so hot outside...)
m Fuck, that heat is gonna be the end of me...
mo No swearing under my roof.
m Maybe you should install an AC unit, because it's hot as hell under {i}\"your roof\"{/i}.
mo Sweat builds character.
m Ugh...
m Hope you're right.
mo I am.
n Trying to ignore the unbearable heat, you go upstairs...
n Finally finding yourself in front of Emily's room.
    n Finally finding yourself in front of Emily's room.
        n Without knocking, you open the door and go inside...
        em Oh!?
        m *Gulp*
        n You stand there for a second, staring at Emily's chest.
        n Finally realizing exactly what you're doing...
        m Shit! Sorry! (What the hell am I staring at?!)
        em It's okay. Let me just put my bra on.
        m Yeah... Sorry, again. (I should've knocked.)
        em Could you help me with this?
        m Oh? Umm... I don't know...
        em Pretty please?
        m *Sigh* Okay.
        n Reluctantly, you get behind her and hook her bra together.
        em Thanks!
        n Again, your eyes involuntarily move south.
        m (Fuck off, brain! STOP!)
        n As you move a step back...
        n Deciding to be a gentleman, you announce your presence at the door.
        em Who is it?
        m It’s me, Em. Can I come in?
        em If you need to...
em And? Did you need something?
m I just wanted to check...
em Check in on me? Aww, that's sweet!
m Yeah...
em Anything else?
m We good?
em No. (Did he forget what he said already?)
m Why not?
em Because... (Because you said that I'm not hot!)
em (And I {i}can't{/i} have that!)
n As a thought pops into her head, she sits on her bed.
em (Hmm... Maybe I could show him how I AM hotter than this \"Jane.\")
em Could you help me with something?
m I guess. What is it?
em Let me just get something under my bed first.
n Slowly, she slides onto the floor.
em (This will be so much fun!)
em So much stuff down here...
m *Gulp*
em Where is it.... (Hope you're getting a good, {i}hard{/i}, look!)
em There you are!
em Ugh! Shit...
em [m!t]... I think I'm stuck. (Hhh, yeah... {i}So stuck{/i}...)
n Pretending like she's getting out, Emily starts wiggling her ass...
em Can you help me get out of here, please?
m Uhh... (Why didn't she put on any pants... That bikini is...)
em Hello?
n You cautiously move behind her as she keeps swinging her hips.
m (She really did grow up.)
m (I mean, look at that...)
m (Get those thoughts out of your head, [m!t]!)
n Naturally, you're unable to stop yourself from stiffening up.
m (Fuck! Not again...)
em Can you, like... Pull me out or something?
m Umm... Yeah, sure. (I already lost count of how many erections I had today.)
m But how?
em Just grab my hips and pull. Duh!
m Right.
n Grabbing her hips...
n You start pulling.
em Harder!
m O-Okay!
n After a little nudging, Emily is still {i}\"stuck\"{/i}.
em Pull harder!
m I'm pulling!
em Ahhh... Harder!
n Getting a little pissed, you pull with all your strength...
n Since she wasn't really stuck, just pretending...
n Your strength surprises her, and she flies out from underneath the bed.
n As you land on your ass, her ass lands on your... Crotch.
em Uhh! (Is that his...)
n For a moment, neither of you move.
em (He got hard?!)
n Suddenly, she springs up.
m (Shit! Did she feel my boner?)
em Umm, thanks. (So much for not being hot enough, hehehe.)
n With her confidence back, Emily just sprawls onto her bed.
m Didn't you need my help with something?
em Already got it.
m What? I don't get it.
em Doesn't matter. (Oh, you're so clueless...)
m Umm... Okay.
m Guess I'll leave you to it then.
em Yeah... Byee!
m (That was strange...)
m (Was she... Teasing me?)
m (Nah. She couldn't have... Why would she do that?)
n As you're finishing up your inner monologue, Kiara pops out of the bathroom.
m Oh, hi!
k It's so fucking hot in here...
k Eve should install an AC...
k I just had a shower, and I'm {i}already{/i} getting sweaty...
m {i}\"Sweat builds character\"{/i}.
k Hah! Bullshit.
m *Chuckle* (Agreed, bullshit!)
m Yaaawn... (I'm so tired.)
m (I only got a few hours of sleep...)
n With your eyes already closing, you go to your room and get into your bed.
m (I could take a quick nap.)
m (Yeah, just to rest my eyes a little...)
n Finally, exhaustion takes over, and you fall asleep.
n A few hours later...
m Hmphh... (It's already dark outside? This was more than a quick nap...)
n You check your phone and notice that it's 2AM.
m (Woah! I slept that long? Damn...)
m (Wonder why no one woke me up for dinner.)
m (Guess they just didn't wanna bother me.)
m (How is it still so hot, this late?!
m *Sigh* (I'll just go grab some water...)
n Still a little blurry-eyed, you exit your room...
n Go downstairs...
n And into the kitchen.
n After rummaging around the fridge a little, you pour yourself a glass of water.
m *Glug* *Glug* *Glug*
m (Blessed be, H2O.)
m (Okay, back to bed...)
n As you're leaving the kitchen, you notice Eve coming down the stairs.
m Hi, Eve.
mo Oh, [m!t]! You startled me!
mo What are you doing up?
m I got thirsty.
m How come no one woke me up?
mo Sorry, when I saw you sleeping, I didn't want to wake you.
m Oh, thought so. It's okay.
m Aaand, why are {i}you{/i} still up?
mo Oh... Uhhh...
mo I couldn't sleep, so thought I'd go for a walk.
m Something bothering you? Want me to come with you?
mo No, no... It's just so hot in here, I could use some air.
m I get it.
mo Anyway, you should go back to bed. The patients will arrive first thing in the morning.
m Yes, ma'am. Good night.
mo *Chuckle* Night.
n Arriving back in your room, it doesn't take long for sleep to take you...
mo Hey.
m Hmph?
mo Sweetie, wake up.
m Huh?
m What time is it?
mo It's 7 AM.
mo Time to wake up.
m Yeah... (I had such a strange dream...)
n Still not fully awake, you don't notice the morning wood you currently have.
n Unlike you, Eve does...
mo Umm... (He's hard again? I should definitely just ignore it.)
m What's the matter?
mo Oh?! Uhh... Nothing! (How am I supposed to ignore a bulge that big?!)
m You sure?
mo Yeah, yeah, it's nothing. (It looks so big...)
mo (Now I wonder what it ACTUALLY looks like... Hhh, silly me!)
m (Why does she keep looking down?)
n A little confused, you glance where her eyes were \"pointing\" at...
m Oh, shit!
mo *Chuckle* Don't worry, it's only natural.
m Yeah... (Not really! Especially with the dream I had...)
m (I think the image of her in lingerie got burned into my mind.)
mo Soooo...
n You interrupt her attempt to change the subject.
m When are the idiots--sorry, {i}\"patients\"{/i} getting here? (Heh...)
mo Don't call them idiots. They're just, well... unadjusted to the real world.
mo And they need our help.
m Yeah, I know... (She didn't get the joke...)
m Fine, when are the PATIENTS getting here?
mo They should be here in an hour or so.
m Great.
mo I'm going to go make you some breakfast.
m Awesome! Thanks, Eve.
mo Don't mention it. See you downstairs.
m See ya'.
n As she leaves, you get up and get dressed.
n Leaving your room...
n You make your way towards the bathroom.
    n You make your way towards the bathroom.
        n *Knock* *Knock*
        k Occupied!
        m You done soon? Gotta pee!
        k I'm in the shower, I'll be done in a few minutes.
        m Okay.
        n With nothing else to do, you wait in front of the bathroom for a few minutes.
        n Soon after, Kiara opens the door, wearing nothing but her lingerie.
        n Racy lingerie, at that.
        k Oh?! You're still here?!
        m *Gulp* I told you, I gotta pee... (What is she wearing?!)
        k Well, don't just stand there, go pee.
        k (I'll have to get used to him being around... Should've taken some clothes to the bathroom with me.)
        m Oh, right! Going! Sorry, I'm still a little sleepy.
        k Riiight... (Wait, was he checking me out?)
        k (Hah! Can't really blame him.)
        n Covered up a lot less than she maybe should be, Kiara strolls towards her room.
            n Covered up a lot less than she maybe should be, Kiara strolls towards her room.
                n Unable to control yourself, you turn your head...
                m (Why is she walking around dressed like that?)
                m (Isn't it a bit too revealing?)
                n Kiara enters her room, but looks at you for a bit before closing the door.
                m (Fuck, I hope she didn't notice...)
                n Pretending nothing happened...
        n Forgetting to knock first, you open the door...
        k Eeek!
        m Shit! Sorry!
        n Almost instantly, you turn around.
        k What the hell, [m!t]?!
        m Sorry! I didn't think it was occupied.
        k *Sigh* Learn to knock.
        m I really had to pee.
        m Why didn't you just lock the door?
        k I didn't expect someone would come in without knocking.
        m You're right, my bad. Won't happen again.
        k It doesn't matter now. Mind going outside so I can get dressed?
        m Right! Sure!
        n Obediently, you leave the bathroom.
        m (Really should have knocked...)
        m (I'll just wait in my room until she's finished.)
        n A few minutes pass...
        n You hear Kiara walking down the hall and the sound of her bedroom door closing.
n You go inside the bathroom.
m Ahhh...
    n Suddenly, you hear the door swing open...
    m Gaahhh!
    n Kiara's jump-scare makes you piss all over your leg.
    k Hah! See? Not cool.
    m I pissed all over myself!
    k Sorry!
    k Byee!
    m What the hell, Kiara?!
    k I said, sorry! (I didn't expect he'd still be taking a piss...)
    m Not cool! Not cool at all!
    k Well, think of it as getting a taste of your own medicine.
    k You'll get over it. ([m!t] is hung? Like, {i}really{/i} hung?! Since when?!)
    m (Now I have to take a shower...)
    n You go to your room for a fresh change of clothes.
    n After a quick shower, you get dressed...
    m (Hope they won't be complete idiots.)
    m (But I'd say that's just wishful thinking.)
    m (The amount of stupidity in the world is only increasing...)
    m (So... Guess I'm fucked...)
    m (Oh, well... Better just accept my fate...)
    m (...)
    m (Hmmm...)
    m (Maybe plants really ARE farming us...)
    m (Giving us oxygen until we eventually drop dead, turning into mulch they can consume...)
    m (...)
    m (This is really taking a while...)
    m (...)
    m (Finally...)
    n Zipping up your pants...
    n You wash your hands.
n And leave the bathroom.
m (Damn... It's already getting pretty hot...)
n Making your way downstairs...
n Eve suddenly pops out from around the corner.
mo Could you please go and wake Emily up?
m Sure.
n Seconds later, you're outside her room.
n Gently, you knock on the door.
m Emily?
n No answer...
m Emily!
n Again, no answer...
m I'm coming in.
n Opening the door, you notice Emily lying on her back, her bedsheets all over the floor.
m (Shit! Her boob fell out of her bra!)
n From downstairs, you hear Eve yelling...
mo Did you wake her up?!
m Working on it!
m Emily!
m (You gotta be kidding me...)
n Unsure if it's a good idea, you walk closer to her.
m Emily, wake up!
n No response...
m Ugh!
m (What do I do?)
    m (What do I do?)
        m (Should probably fix her bra before waking her up.)
        m (I really hope she doesn't wake up...)
        n You move your hand closer...
        n Gently grab her bra...
        n And pull it up.
        em Mmmm...
        n Finally, you poke her forehead.
        m Wake up!
        em Mmmmm...
        em Hmph...
        m Time to wake up...
        em Wha... Already?
        m Umm... Yeah.
        em What time is it?
        m It is--was 7 AM, about twenty minutes ago.
        m Breakfast will be ready soon.
        em Ughhh...
        em It's too early...
        m Yeah, yeah. See ya' downstairs.
        em *Yawn* Yeah...
        n With that, you leave her bedroom.
        n You poke her forehead.
        m Wake up!
        em Mmmmm...
        em Hmph...
        m Time to wake up...
        em Wha... Already?
        m Umm... Yeah.
        em What time is it?
        m It is--was 7 AM, twenty minutes ago.
        m Breakfast will be ready soon.
        em Ughhh...
        em It's too early...
        n Instinctively, your eyes jump towards her chest.
        m (Do I say something?)
        m (Nah, I don't wanna make a big deal out of it. Better just leave...)
        m See ya' downstairs.
        em Yawn! Yeah...
        n With that, you leave her bedroom.
        em (Oh? Did my boob fall out while I was sleeping?)
        em (Why didn't he say anything?)
        em *Giggle* (He probably just wanted to stare at it... Pervert.)
        em (Oh, well... {i}\"Oopsy\"{/i}.)
n Trying not to think about what just happened, you make your way down the stairs...
n And into the kitchen.
mo Did you wake Emily up?
m Yeah...
m Is there any coffee?
mo Huh?
m What?
mo Since when do you drink coffee?
m Since I'm in college and have to study all night long.
mo *Chuckle* Okay, coffee it is. (He's so grown up...)
n She pours you a cup.
mo Here you go. Careful, it's hot.
m Thanks, Eve.
m Hey, Eve, I'm not that hungry. I'll just go chill on the couch.
mo But...
m I'll eat later. Don't worry.
n As you sit down...
n You hear Emily yell from upstairs.
em I think I can see them!
n Everyone gathers in front of the house, waiting for the van.
k Didn't you say they were here?
em I meant, any second now.
k So where are they?
mo I think I can hear the van.
m (I hope there aren't more than five idiots aboard.)
n The van doors open.
m (Here we go... What do we have first... An animal abuser?)
m (Perhaps a dendrophile...)
m (Maybe a...)
m (Whaaa?!)
m (I-It's a...)
m (Girl?!)
n Before your brain has time to even process what just happened...
m (Another girl?!)
m (This is, umm... Unexpected!)
m (Holy shit! Another one?!)
m (Is that it? No guys this year? How?! Why?!)
n The girls line up next to the van...
k (What the fuck?!)
em (Weee! So cool!)
mo (This year will be different, that's for sure.)
m (This is gonna be interesting...)
n Eve takes a step forward.
mo Hello, girls. Welcome to Camp Red Falls.
noname Hi!
mo I'm doctor Daniels. And I will be your caretaker for the duration of your stay here.
mo You can go unpack first. Once you're done, we'll meet in front of your residences.
mo Take the girls to their cabins.
m Umm, yeah! Sure.
m So... Please come with me!
m (Well, this is unexpected...)
m (How come we only have female patients this year?)
n As the girls follow you, you give them the basic tour of the place...
m This is the main building... That's where the staff sleeps.
m Over yonder is our community house...
m You'll have private and group sessions there, among other things.
m The lake is clean, and you can swim in it whenever you have time off.
m And...
nao Hey, I'm Naomi, and you're kinda hot.
nao Are you also a patient? (Dibs, I saw him first!)
m Uhh, no... I work here... (Did she just call me \"hot\"?)
nao So, you'll be around?
m Yeah, I'll be around. But I can't--
nao Great! Then we'll get to know each other better. You'll love my company, I'm sure.
m Aha, right... (Who is this chick? She starts hitting on me the moment she arrives?)
m (I mean, not that it doesn't build up my ego a little... She's smoking hot, but...)
m *Sigh* (Guess you can't expect normal behavior in this damn place.)
m (They are getting rehabilitated, after all...)
m (This one's probably a nymphomaniac or some shit like that.)
nao Something wrong? You don't enjoy my company?
m No, no, nothing like that. I just...
nao Duuuh... Of course you enjoy my company. I mean, who doesn't?
m (Not a nympho, but a fucking narcissist...)
m *Nervous chuckle* Yeah, must be it... (How self-absorbed can you get?)
nao So... I was thinking. Why don't you show me around later? Give me a {i}private{/i} tour, hmm?
v Naomi, you can't talk to the staff like that... (I mean, he is cute, but still...)
nao Maybe {i}you{/i} can't, fatty.
nao Who are you to tell me what I can or can't do, huh?!
v I didn't mean...
nao Just shut up, Violet! Ugh, all brawn, no brain...
b *Chuckle* Not even five minutes in, and they're already bickering like children...
s Indeed...
b So? What are you in here for?
s Fire.
b Ooh, a matchstick enthusiast! We'll have so much fun!
b Tell me what happened.
s I... May have gone overboard while recruiting followers.
b \"Followers\"?
s Yes, the Puncturing Flame.
b And what's that?
s It's a religion. In short, we worship fire and its beauty.
s Interested? Would you consider joining us?
b Ah, I see... S-Sounds interesting, I'll think about it.
b (Oh God, I can't believe I'm in the same boat as these weirdos...)
s *Sniff* *Sniff* Do I smell BBQ? Where's the campfire?
v At least I'm not an empty, manipulative bitch!
nao Wanna repeat that, fatty?!
m LADIES, ENOUGH!
n As you raise your voice, all of them freeze up.
m Good. Let's get you settled, then.
m You'll have plenty of time to rip each other's throats out during your stay.
m Moving on... These are your new homes.
m You'll each be sharing one with another person.
nao Share? But there are three cabins, why can't I go solo in the third cabin?
m Because it's good practice. Getting to know one another, sharing the rehabilitation experience...
nao Fucking stupid... I want my own place.
m It's also because those are the rules. (Shit! I forgot about the guidelines completely.)
s Calm down, Naomi. You cannot escape the prophecy, anyway.
nao *Grumble* Fine! I'm taking that one!
nao Come, Stacy, you should join me. You seem like a {i}fun{/i} roomie, unlike {i}fatty{/i} here...
s Sure. I do not believe the Pheonix-Lotus would mind.
m (\"Prophecy\"? \"Phoenix-Lotus\"? What the fuck is she talking about?)
m Anyway, it's unlocked. Keys are in the lock, on the inside.
m Take your time and get settled.
n Without delay, Naomi briskly goes towards the cabin, with Stacy following suit.
b Guess that leaves us two. (At least I'm not grouped with that flame-natic.)
v Yeah, okay...
b You gonna pick us up later?
b (Hmm, Naomi sure knows how to quickly separate the wheat from the chaff, he is quite handsome...)
m Probably, but you have time to get comfortable until then.
b Oh, lovely. Well, can't wait to see you again.
m ({i}\"Can't wait to see me\"{/i}?)
n Somewhat dumbfounded by her choice of words, you just stand there.
n Wondering if this girl just hit on you as well.
m *Sigh* (It's gonna be a long-ass summer...)
m (I better go get The Guidelines from my room.)
n Finally managing to squeeze some words out...
m Umm, yeah... Bye.
b Byee!

    m (Where should I go?)
        m (Where should I go?)
m (A key? Wonder what it opens...)
m (Guess I'll find out soon enough.)
    m (I haven't seen Kiara since the patients arrived. She must be holed-up in her room.)
    n Approaching her room, you knock.
    m Kiara, you here?
    n Not hearing a response, you open the door...
    n And enter her room.
    m Kiara? (Where the hell is she?)
m (A notebook?)
m (No, it's Kiara's diary?!)
    m (No, it's Kiara's diary?!)
        m (It's Kiara's diary. I wonder what she wrote...)
        m (Maybe she mentioned me...)
        m (We're still somewhat distant because of that one time...)
        m (Maybe I can find out how she feels.)
        m ...
        m (Well, Kiara, it's your fault for leaving it out in the open like this...)
        m (It's like you {i}want{/i} someone to read it.)
        n You pick up her diary and begin flipping through its pages.
        n The pages are mostly filled with uneventful days spent at Red Falls...
        n Some mentions of Eve, but nothing out of the ordinary.
        m (This was a few years back. Just before college...)
        n At last, you notice a passage with your name in it.
        n (\"Fateful night\"?! \"All these feelings\"?!...)
        m (Does Kiara still have a thing for me? But she also says she'd like it if things returned to normal...)
        m Fuck... (Maybe I shouldn't have read this.)
        m (Now I have to make sure she doesn't notice anything weird about my behavior.)
        m *Sigh* Problem after problem, huh?
        n You place the diary back in the same position as when you found it.
        n You learned more than you hoped for, perhaps even more than you wished for...
        n But, nonetheless, you got some juicy info out of it. 
        m (I better leave the room. Don't wanna get caught with my pants down...)
        n Before anyone sees you, you leave Kiara's room.
        m (It {i}is{/i} quite tempting, but...)
        m (I really shouldn't read her diary, even though I'm curious as hell.)
        m (I might find out something I'd rather not know...)
        n Not wanting to get caught, you leave Kiara's journal alone.
m (Hey! That's a photo with all of us!)
m (I should get a copy made, too.)
m (Everyone looks so happy.)
m (Eve looks gorgeous...)
m (Kiara and Emily too.)
n And then it hits you...
m (Wait, where am I?!)
m I'm not in the photo...
m (SERIOUSLY?! I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT IN THE PHOTO?!)
m (But how? Why? When was this taken?)
m (By the look of their clothes, it was definitely taken during the summer. Probably at Red Falls, too.)
m (It doesn't say...)
m (The time stamp must be on the back of the picture.)
m (I'll have to open up the frame somehow, if I wanna get to the bottom of this.)
    m (I'll have to open up the frame somehow, if I wanna get to the bottom of this.)
        m (As much as I'd like to know why...)
        m (It's probably best to remain ignorant.)
        m (Not to mention, if Kiara finds out I've been snooping around her room, she'll strangle me in my sleep.)
        m (I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation as to why I'm not \"part of the gang\"...)
        m (I can't just let this slide. I at least gotta know when it was taken.)
        n Poking around a little, you try opening the picture's frame.
        m (It's stuck...)
        m (Fine, I'll just claw my way in.)
        n *Snap*
        m Perfect... (I broke it...)
        m (At least it's on the back side. Hope she doesn't notice.)
        m *Sigh* (What's done is done. Might as well find out...)
        m (\"August\"? Two years ago?)
        m (That's when I started college, right? And before that...)
        m (Before that, Kiara and I...)
        m (Shit. I just left after creating so much chaos...)
        m (No wonder I'm not in the photo.)
        m (No wonder Kiara's been acting weird.)
m (Is that what I think it is?)
n You crouch down to take a closer look.
m (It really is my old volleyball!)
m (Wow, she still has it after all this time.)
m (Aww, man. I'd love to play again.)
m (I still remember that time we played... All those girls in swimwear, jumping around, sweating...)
m (Wait, Kiara was also there with me! That's right, we played on the same team.)
m Huh... (She looked amazing...)
m (We've had a lot of good memories together, haven't we?)
m (I just hope she thinks of them as fondly as I do.)
m (Her perfume bottles.)
m (Looks expensive...)
m (I doubt she bought them all by herself...)
m (Wouldn't be surprised if she got one from a previous patient or something like that.)
m (Do I...)
    m (Do I...)
        m (Yeeeeah, I'd rather not...)
        m (Snooping around her room is weird enough as it is.)
        m (No need to sniff a girl's perfume like some creep.)
        m ...
        m (Shit, Jane was right... Maybe I {i}am{/i} a creep.)
        m Ah, well...
m *Sniff* *Sniff*
m Ahhhhh... (Smells wonderful.)
m (Just like Kiara...)
m ...
m *Cough* (I should probably put that back.)
m (Haven't been in her room for years...)
m (I wonder if anything's changed.)
n Without much thought, you try opening the door...
m Hmm, locked. (Now I'm even more curious.)
m (Wait, maybe that key...)
n Cautious not to make too much noise...
n You insert the key into the lock and turn it.
m (Lucky me, it's the right one.)
n You open the door and walk into the bedroom.
m Hmm... Looks more or less how I remember. (Not sure what I was expecting...)
m (Maybe the key's just for privacy's sake, 'cause of the patients and all.)
m (Well, can't hurt to look around.)
    m (Hmm, nothing interesting in here.)
    m (Emily?)
    m (Looks like she's talking to one of the patients. Wonder what it's about...)
    m (She seems really into it...)
    m Huh. (Guess Emily picked up some social skills while working here.)
    m (What's that?)
    m (A box? Not sure if I wanna know the contents...)
    m Ehh, might as well.
    n You pull the box out.
    m (What's behind door number one?)
    m ...
    m ...
    m (I'm not sure what I expected to find in a box hidden under the bed...)
    m (Oh, God. I can feel the mental scars growing.)
        m (What's that sound outside?)
m (Haven't been in her room for years...)
m (I wonder if anything's changed.)
n Without much thought, you try opening the door...
m Hmm, locked. (Now I'm even more curious.)
m (I'll have to find the key somewhere.)
m (Asking for it would probably sound weird.)
n As you enter the kitchen, you notice Kiara hanging around.
    m Hey, Kiara.
    k Hi, have you finished your chores?
    m Yeah, the girls are getting settled in.
    k And The Guidelines?
    m Uhhhhhh...
    k *Chuckle* Don't worry, I won't bite.
    k Just make sure to give a copy to every patient.
    k Well, I have some shit to do, I'll talk to you later.
    m 'Kay, later.
    m (Shit, it's Kiara. I better not slip up.)
    k Eeeek! Oh, it's you... You scared me. (Still not used to him popping up.)
    m My bad.
    k What are you skulking around the house for?
    m Oh, ummm, nothing. Just wandering around, that's all.
    k Mhm, I bet. (He's hiding something...)
    m Really!
    k You know I've been working here for years, right? I can tell when something's up.
    m (She doesn't believe me... I'll have to come up with a better excuse.)
    k Hellooo?
        k Hellooo?
            m You don't look too cheery. Something wrong?
            k Hmm, can't hide anything from you, can I?
            m You read me, I read you..
            k *Sigh* Yeah, I guess something's wrong.
            k Nothing serious, but annoying, nonetheless.
            m What about?
            k Don't you worry your pretty little head. I'll manage.
            m You can tell me if something's bothering you. I'll listen.
            k I know you would.
            k Maybe I'll even take you up on that offer, but another time. Okay?
            m Whenever you need me.
            k I'm glad you're here. I missed you.
            m I missed you too.
            n You sit there for a moment, exchanging looks in silence.
            k Right, ummm...
            m Okay, good talk.
            k *Chuckle* Yeah, I have some shit to do anyway, I'll see you later.
            m Later, Kiara.
            n With that, she leaves the kitchen.
            m (Phew, that was a close one.)
            m Ohhh... Uhhh... Ummm... Ehhh... (Fuck, I can't come up with anything on the spot.)
            k I think I know what this is about. (He's still thinking about it...)
            k I tried to put it in the past, but I see you're still struggling to do the same.
            m No, it's not about... (Hit the nail on the head. You're too good at this, Kiara...)
            k Spare me. I can see you cringing anxiously around me...
            k There's only one reason...
            m ...
            k I thought you had grown up, maybe I was wrong.
            m Kiara, I...
            k It's fine. I was naïve thinking everything would return to how it once was.
            k I'm ready to let go, but I shouldn't just expect you to do the same.
            m Kiara, stop!
            n Raising your voice catches her off-guard.
            m Yes, it crosses my mind here and there, but I don't care about that anymore.
            m We've known each other forever, for fuck's sake.
            m And seeing how you're still bringing it up doesn't really give off the impression of coming to grips with it.
            k What would you know about anything? About me?
            k You left for college, didn't even call or anything.
            k If it weren't for Christmas, I probably wouldn't have seen you at all!
            m *Sigh* I did kind of run away, didn't I?
            m But I'm here now, and I'm tired of avoiding you.
            m I want our relationship to be normal, \"like it was\".
            k We'll see about that...
            k Oh, and [m!t]... I hope you really mean what you're saying.
            n Without uttering another word, Kiara walks away.
            m *Sigh* Fuck... (It's still bothering her. Can't say I don't feel the same...)
m (I've wasted enough time already... I should just get the guidelines before anyone notices.)
m Ah, there they are. (Thought for a second I lost them.)
n You take another look at the papers...
m Hmm... (They haven't changed much.)
m (Same old crappy guidelines that mostly protect the institution, not the patients, blah-blah-blah...)
m Oh? (There are a few new ones I haven't seen before...)
m \"Romantic relations are strictly forbidden\", \"All personnel must not become emotionally attached to patients\"...
m (What the fuck is this? New rules? And pretty obvious ones at that...)
m (Did something happen? Maybe that's the reason why all the patients are female this time.)
m (I'll ask Eve about it.)
n After going through the guidelines again, you leave to distribute them.
n Walking down the stairs, you bump into Eve.
n Definitely not wanting her to notice the guidelines being delivered just now, you hide them behind your back...
mo Have you finished everything I asked?
m Uh-huh...
mo And the patients are in their designated cabins?
m \"Designated\"? I just brought them there, no one told me anything about \"designated rooms\".
mo Of course they have designated rooms, what did you expect?
m I didn't think it was that important...
m I'll go deal with it right away.
mo Oh, and...
m What?
mo Those guidelines you're hiding should've been in their rooms {i}before{/i} the patients got here...
m ...
m *Sigh* (They've probably already settled in. This is gonna be a pain...)
m (Where do I even go first?)
n A little hesitant, you head towards the cabins...
    n You approach the first cabin...
    n As you get closer, you hear voices from inside.
    nao No, no, no! I told you, like, five times already, be careful with that and put the lighter away!
    n You knock on the door.
    s I doubt the Phoenix-Lotus cares about such trivialities...
    nao These \"trivialities\" are worth more than your whole family's net worth!
    n You knock again.
    nao And what the fuck is a \"Phoenix-Lotus\", anyway?!
    nao Your deity obviously doesn't have a sense of fashion!
    nao Can't tell the difference between a dress and a top?
    s The Phoenix-Lotus surely has a more refined fashion taste than you...
    nao Are you seriou--
    n Everything goes quiet for a brief moment...
    n Before the door swings open.
    n With Naomi standing on the other side of the threshold.
    nao Sorry, handsome, but not right now. We're busy.
    m Hey, can I borrow you for a second?
    nao Mmmm, couldn't wait, could you? (Of course. How could he resist?)
    m That's not...
    nao Alright, guess I have a minute... (I should do my research, anyway.)
    m I came to give you these guidelines.
    nao Oh, wonderful...
    m *Sigh* And... I'll have to ask one of you to move.
    n The moment she hears this, Naomi's flirty behavior shifts to annoyance...
    nao Excuse me? Why?
    m The sleeping arrengements were predetermined, it seems.
    nao What does that even mean?
    m It means you have to swap roomies.
    nao Why?! That's such a waste of time. Plus, I don't want to.
    nao I'm fine with Stacy... Even though she's...
    nao Well, {i}the way she is{/i}.
    m I'm not the one calling the shots, sorry.
    nao I literally unpacked {i}this second{/i}.
    m (As far as I could tell, Stacy unpacked your shit while you were giving orders.)
    m Again, sorry for the inconvenience, I wasn't briefed about it.
    nao *Tsk* Very unprofessional...
    m *Sigh* Tell me about it.
    nao Hmm... (I was expecting him to get all defensive, but he just agreed. He's not even sarcastic.)
    nao You can ask Stacy if she's willing to move.
    nao 'Cause I'm definitely not moving an inch.
    nao Who am I paired up with, anyway?
    nao I hope it's not that gorilla.
    m If you mean Violet, I'm afraid it is.
    nao HUH?! That makes no sense!
    nao We're total opposites, how is that supposed to work?!
    m I told you, I'm not the one calling the shots...
    m Plus, you two might have more in common than you think.
    nao That's fucking bullshit, I'm not doing it.
    m You're here for rehabilitation, {i}not{/i} a vacation.
    m Going out of your comfort zone might actually do you good.
    n Naomi looks annoyed, but remains silent.
    n Whether she saw logic in your words or you struck a nerve, she stops complaining.
    nao Fine... But Stacy is the one moving. I'm staying here. (Again with the fucking \"comfort zone\"...)
    m It's all the same to me. I'll leave you two to figure it out.
    nao [m!t]!
    m Yeah?
    nao Do you have a girlfriend?
    m Huh? Why do you ask? (A little too upfront, but okay...)
    nao I'm just curious. (Plus, I'm interested in what type of prey I'm dealing with.)
    m Lookin' to apply for the position?
    n Your words catch Naomi off-guard, causing her to blush a little.
    nao No, don't be so full of yourself.
    m *Chuckle* If you must know, though. Yes, I'm seeing someone.
    m You know, we're having fun.
    nao Good for you. (He's perrrfect!)
    nao Bye now.
    m Sorry, I still need to talk to Stacy for a moment.
    nao ...
    nao Humph...
    n After a brief second, she moves out of the way and lets you enter.
    s Hello, sir. Have you come to join The Puncturing Flame?
    m Uhh, no, not right now.
    s Shame... We could use more people with {i}good genes{/i} like yourself.
    m (\"Genes\"?! The fuck is she talking about?)
    m Yeah, maybe some other time.
    s Alright, we'll wait until the flame calls to you.
    m Umm... Yeeeaahhh...
    m So, there was a misunderstanding with the housing.
    m You should've been paired with Belle, doctor's orders.
    s I see... Yes, there were signs around her, should've expected this.
    m Yeeeaahhh, ummm... Can you maybe move your stuff over to the other cabin?
    s I doubt Naomi's the type that pleases others, so...
    s I'll comply.
    m Excellent, glad you're so... cooperative.
    s Of course, cooperation is the first step in leading a successful flock.
    m Right... (A \"flock\"?! The hell?!)
    m Anyway, take this... House rules and guidelines. Read them.
    s Awww, thank you! This will prove excellent kindling.
    m Yeeeaahhh, try to read it before you burn it.
    s *Giggle* I can't promise anything.
    m Alright, I'll be around if you need help.
    s May The Charred Kings lead your way.
    m Yeeeaahhh, I'll follow them wherever...
    nao You finally done?
    m Yeah, all done. I'll see you later.
    nao Take care, handsome.
    m \"Handsome\"?
    nao Surprised? You shouldn't be.
    m *Chuckle* (Hasn't heard of subtlety, has she?)
    n As you turn around to answer...
    n You notice Stacy lying on her bed.
    m (Whoa!)
    m (I can see under Stacy's skirt!)
    m (Holy shit, she's not wearing any underwear!)
    m (Fuck, I shouldn't be looking at that!)
    m (I really gotta stop getting myself in these situations...)
    n Finally, you leave their cabin.
    n You approach the second cabin...
    n And knock on the door.
    m (No one's answering, are they even inside?)
    n Leaning towards the door...
    n You take a peek.
    n Immediately noticing one of the girls inside, getting undressed.
    m (Holy shit! She's half naked!)
    m (Wow, nice tits...)
    m (I really shouldn't, though...)
    m ...
    m (I better move. If she sees me, all hell will break loose.)
    m (I'll just knock on the door a bit harder, this time.)
    n Making sure not to overdo it, you bang on the door.
    n After a few seconds...
    b Just a second!
    n One of the girls greets you on the doorstep.
    b Yes?
    m Hello, hope I'm not intruding.
    b Not at all, come in, come in.
    b I'm Belle, by the way.
    m (Oh, right. We never got a chance to properly meet.)
    m [m!t].
    b How can I help, [m!t]?
    m There was a misunderstanding with the cabins.
    b What do you mean?
    m Nothing serious, but you'll have to swap roomies.
    b Oh, okay. So? Who should I pair up with?
    m The religious one, Stacy.
    b Ahh, okay... Should I stay here or move? (Just hope I won't wake up on fire...)
        m You stay here, she'll move in with you.
        m Doesn't matter, you can figure it out later, but you should be staying with her.
    b Okay, I don't mind.
    m Oh, right. Almost forgot to give you this...
    b What is it?
    m Just The Guidelines. You should read them.
    n After a quick look...
    b \"Romantic relationships are strictly forbidden\", \"All personnel must not become emotionally attached to patients\"...
    m Yeah, those are new. Not sure how or why those happened, but...
    b Guess your hands are tied then... Too bad. (Huh, I smell a challenge.)
    m First off, I'm seeing someone...
    m Second, I shouldn't even have to mention how {i}\"irregular\"{/i} it is for patients to have intimate relationships with their doctors.
    b Oh? You're a doctor, [m!t]?
    m No, but that--
    b Then why trouble yourself, if it doesn't affect you?
    m The Guidelines say \"personnel\", not \"doctors\". Rules apply to all.
    b *Giggle* I won't tell if you won't...
    m *Sigh* (Who the hell {i}are{/i} these chicks?)
    m Hmm, I just noticed...
    m Where's the purple-haired one, uhh...
    b You mean, Violet? Said she needed some fresh air.
    b Sports type, can't hold still for five minutes...
    b Hasn't even unpacked. *Chuckle*
    m Okay, I'll go look for her. Thanks.
    b Don't mention it. You should come and visit more often. *Wink*
    m I'll think about it. (Jesus, am I seeing things or are they all hitting on me? Is that the reason they're here?)
    m (She said that Violet went outside...)
    n Looking around, you spot Violet doing some stretches.
    n Coming closer, you see that she's quite fit.
    n Surprisingly, you failed to notice that until now.
    m Hey, I've been looking for you. (Damn, her body looks pretty firm.)
    v Oh, ummm... \"Looking for me\"? (That's kinda sweet. Does he {i}like--{/i}) 
    m I need to give you these guidelines. You should read them.
    v Oh, right, of course. (Yeah, why would he...)
    m I haven't introduced myself properly...
    v It's [m!t], right?
    m Yeah, how did you know?
    v I-Uhhhh... You mentioned it when we got here.
    m Did I? I don't remember.
    v I'm sure I heard you say it.
    m Oh, okay then. And you're Violet?
    v That's me.
    m Well, nice to meet you, Violet.
    m What are you doing here, anyway?
    v Umm, I needed some space, and I had to do some maintenance.
    m \"Maintenance\"?
    v Yeah, stretching, running, stuff like that.
    v The ride was pretty long, and I don't like it when my body gets stiff.
    m Yeah, you do look like you train a lot. (She's obviously fit, but she's still curvy as fuck.)
    v Really? Oh... *Chuckle* Ummm...
    m Belle mentioned something about sports... Are you a professional?
    n Violet's playful expression is quickly replaced by a saddened look.
    v *Sigh* Yeah... I was, actually... For a while...
    v But then...
    n You spot some bitterness in her words.
    m Ah, I see... It's okay, I won't pry.
    m Also, is it too forward to ask why you're here, Violet? I mean, you seem completely normal to me.
    m (Unlike the rest...)
    v Oh, umm... *Nervous chuckle* I wouldn't be here if I was \"normal\".
    v Everyone has a reason, mine is... Maybe a bit {i}different{/i}. (\"A bit\"?)
    m Care to share?
    v Uhhhhh, I'd rather not talk about it... (It'll definitely scare him off.)
    m Okay, I understand.
    m Well, you have The Guidelines. Read them when you have the chance.
    v I will, I promise.
    m Good, I'll leave you to it then.
    m You should go back to camp, we'll probably have a meeting soon.
    v Okay, I won't be long.
    n After the quick talk, you go back to camp.
n The girls are briefed, and The Guidelines distributed - all loose ends are tied.
m (Guess that's it for now.)
m (I should probably find Eve, see what's next on the \"to-do list\".)
n On your way back, you see Eve heading towards you.
m Hi.
mo Hey there, spying on our patients, hmm?
m Yeah, nothing's more attractive than unstable chicks.
m You're in a good mood today.
mo I'm always in a good mood, comes with age.
n Eve approaches the patients' residences and calls out...
mo Laaaaadieees! If you're done unpacking, I'd like you to meet us outside.
n Turning back around to face you...
mo I hope you're ready. The main event is about to begin.
n One by one, the girls slowly congregate around Eve.
mo Hello again, everyone.
mo I see everyone has already gathered, very good.
mo We're glad you applied to Red Falls. That was probably one of the better choices you'll make in your life.
svi *Scoff*
mo Over the course of the next two months, we'll slowly get to know each other.
mo We have lots of activities planned for you, so please, relax and enjoy your stay.
mo Get to know one another, staff included.
mo Push through your inadequacies and become better people.
mo That is all.
mo Does anyone have any questions?
n Without waiting for an answer...
mo No? Good.
mo Alright, your first order of business for getting to know one another...
mo Is to strip naked.
