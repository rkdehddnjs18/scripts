Narr:	Still hesitant, you make your way towards the house.
Me: 	(So many memories here...)
Me: 	(Bad ones... But I can't lie... Some good ones too.)
Me: 	(Do I knock? Or just go in?)
Me: 	(Maybe it would be better if...)
Narr:	Suddenly, the door bursts open.
Emily:	Dennis!
Me: 	Hi...
Narr:	She jumps you, almost making you lose your balance.
Emily:	Oh, how I missed you!
Me: 	Missed you too, Em...
Emily:	Awww!
Narr:	A few seconds pass while neither of you says anything.
Me: 	Would you mind climbing down now?
Emily:	Nope, not yet!
Narr:	You did have your reason for asking...
Narr:	Emily's breasts were pressed hard against your chest.
Me: 	You've really grown.
Emily:	I did?
Me: 	Yeah, and you're heavy.
Narr:	Hearing this, she gets off.
Emily:	Hey! That's no way to talk to a lady.
Me: 	Oh? So now you're a lady?
Emily:	Yeah... Not really...
Emily:	Never mind. Come in!
Narr:	For a split second, you hesitate...
Narr:	But Emily grabs your hand.
Narr:	And pulls you inside.
Emily:	Aaaand...
Me: 	And?
Emily:	How's college?
Me: 	Oh. Good, I guess...
Emily:	Must be better than good, since you haven't shown your face around here in a while.
Me: 	You see, I...
Kiara:	Look what the cat dragged in.
Me: 	Hi, Kiara.
Kiara:	Hey.
tut:	This game features something called "x-ray".
tut:	Use your cursor to highlight and press the left mouse button in the upper left corner.
tut:	This will enter an "x-ray mode". You can leave it by pressing anywhere on the screen.
tut:	Try it yourself.
Me: 	Didn't know you're back at camp.
Kiara:	Didn't think I would be.
Kiara:	Anyway, nice to see you, Dennis.
Me: 	You too.
Kiara:	We'll talk later. Gotta go prepare the cabins.
Me: 	Sure.
Me: 	(Not even a hug... Well, that's kind of to be expected, since...)
Narr:	Something else grabs your attention.
Emily:	Anyone at college catch your eye?
Me: 	Huh?
Emily:	College? Hot girls?
Me: 	Hahaha, sure... There are some hot ones out there.
Me: 	But, I'm kinda seeing someone.
Emily:	You are?! Who?!
Emily:	What's her name?!
Emily:	How old is she?!
Emily:	Are you taking classes together?!
Emily:	Is she hot?
Emily:	Do you have a picture of her?!
Emily:	What am I even talking about? Of course you do!
Emily:	Why haven’t you already shown me?!
Me: 	Could I unpack first?
Emily:	Right... Silly me.
Emily:	Sorry, I just get so excited!
Me: 	Some things never change, I guess. (Still, she did grow up so much.)
Emily:	Guess not. *Giggle*
Emily:	Oh right, that reminds me!
Emily:	Eve said you should unpack once you arrive and she'll come and find you.
Emily:	Here's the key to your room.
Emily:	You better get going. So we still have time to hang out afterwards.
Me: 	Sounds good to me!
tut:	This game features navigation.
tut:	Use your cursor to highlight interactable objects like doors, items or characters.
tut:	To interact with them, simply press the left mouse button.
tut:	The game also has a HINT system. If you get stuck, click on question mark in the upper right corner to see what you need to do next.
tut:	To use the map during free roam mode, click on the compass icon below the other icons in the sidebar on the right side of the screen.
tut:	Upon clicking the compass icon, the map of your current location will appear on the screen.
Me: 	Where did I put the key?
            Me: 	Oh! Here it is!
            Me: 	Hmm, I can’t find it. Maybe if I–
            Me: 	Oh, it’s unlocked!
Narr:	As you open the door...
Narr:	An overwhelming sense of nostalgia washes over you.
Me: 	Heh...(It's still the same.)
Me: 	(So many memories...)
Me: 	(It almost feels good being back.)
Me: 	(Almost...)
Me: 	Jane?
Narr:	You open the message. Only to find a hot, nude selfie from Jane.
Jane:	*Still in bed. Wish you were here.*
Me: 	*Damn! Girl! You need to warn me before sending something like this.
Jane:	*I do?*
Me: 	*Yes.*
Jane:	*Okay. Warning!*
Narr:	As any man would, you start the video...
Narr:	Immediately, you feel your pants tighten.
Narr:	Though, as luck would have it...
Narr:	The door suddenly opens.
Eve:	I heard you were back home!
Eve:	But I had to see for myself.
Narr:	As fast as you can, you put down the phone.
Me: 	Hi, Eve.(Shit!)
Eve:	Stand up, silly! Give me a hug!
Narr:	You stand up to give her a hug
Narr:	She comes in to hug you, but you try your best she doesn’t feel your crotch.
Eve:	It's good to see you, Dennis.
Eve:	So good to see you.
Me: 	Yeah, good to see you too, Eve.
Eve:	Oh, how you've grown.
Me: 	Yeah... You too, Eve.
Eve:	Ha-ha. Still funny as always.
Me: 	*Chuckle* You know me.
Eve:	Oh, how I missed you!
Narr:	Without giving you a chance to react, she hugs you... Hard.
Narr:	As she presses against you, she feels your bulge.
Eve:	Oh! I see you've grown in other places too?
Eve:	*Chuckle* Happy to see me?
Narr:	Instantly, you pull away.
Me: 	Eve!
Eve:	What? I'm just joking.
Me: 	I know, but still...(She's always been like this.)
Me: 	(Not sure why she gets such a kick out of messing with me like this...)
Eve:	Hahaha! You were always so cute when embarrassed.
Eve:	Although, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Me: 	Yeah... Yeah... I know the talk. "It's normal at my age"... Blah, blah, blah...
Eve:	I wasn't talking about that... I was talking about the size.
Me: 	Eve! (She seriously doesn't know how to let it go.)
Eve:	Hahahah! Just joking! Calm down.
Eve:	Jeez! Since when did you get so "stiff"?
Me: 	Will you stop it?!
Eve:	*Chuckle* Okay, okay. I'll stop.
Me: 	*Sigh* Thank you.
Eve:	No, thank you for letting me feel it.
Me: 	HEY! You said you'll stop. (Not sure why I even believed her...)
Eve:	That was the last one. I promise.
Me: 	Good.
Eve:	This is the best thing to do in awkward situations like this.
Narr:	Knowing what follows, you sit on the bed...
Eve:	If we didn't make a joke out of it, you would've been thinking whether I felt it or not.
Eve:	And I would've been thinking, "Why does Dennis have an erection?"
Eve:	That means we'd both be thinking about your... Ahmm... And that's a lot more awkward.
Eve:	It would leave a scar on your young, impressionable brain.
Eve:	Not a big one, but... For the next couple of days, you would be thinking, "Did Eve feel my erection?"
Eve:	It would go through your head every time you saw me. You'd be confused, even worried, about it.
Eve:	This way...
Me: 	Eve, stop it.
Me: 	I get it!
Me: 	You don't need to over-analyze me, or this situation.
Eve:	Oh, right! Sorry! Work habit...
Me: 	I know.
Eve:	Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Me: 	It's okay.
Eve:	I know I probably ruined your summer...
Eve:	But, I really needed you here.
Me: 	So, what's going on?
Eve:	As I mentioned on the phone, things are going to be different this year.
Me: 	What "things"?
Eve:	The patients.
Me: 	What, you're no longer taking in fappers and bullies?
Eve:	No, we graduated to serial killers.
Me: 	WHAT?!
Eve:	*Chuckles* I'm joking, Dennis.
Me: 	That wasn't really funny.
Eve:	*Chuckle* Best I let you unpack.
Eve:	We can talk more during dinner.
Me: 	Sure.
Eve:	Okay. I need to get back to work, anyway.
Eve:	See you later.
Me: 	Later, Eve.
Narr:	As she leaves, you turn towards your luggage...
tut:	Panties are a form of collectable item scattered across the camp in various locations. Some are easier to spot...
tut:	while others will be hidden away in hard to see places.
tut:	Collecting panties will unlock special images in the gallery, so keep your eyes open for them in each scene!
Me: 	(I should finally unpack.)
Me: 	(And I gotta make sure not to forget about Jane's text...)
Narr:	Around 20 minutes later...
Me: 	(All done. Now to help Kiara finish setting up.)
hint:	Go to the camp area.
Me: 	Need help?
Kiara:	I'm doing the last cabin.
Me: 	So, yes or no?
Kiara:	Sure, why not.
Me: 	Say...
Kiara:	Huh?
Me: 	Eve mentioned something...
Kiara:	What?
Me: 	That she's taking in different patients this time around?
Me: 	You know anything about that?
Kiara:	Hmmm, she didn't tell me anything.
Me: 	Nothing?
Kiara:	Nope. She's probably screwing with you.
Kiara:	It's always the same guys since my first year here.
Kiara:	Delinquent boys and wannabe bad-asses.
Me: 	So... Your type, right?
Kiara:	*Chuckle* Maybe...
Me: 	You always loved it when they arrived.
Me: 	Me, on the other hand...
Kiara:	So what if they didn't like you?
Kiara:	Can you blame them?
Kiara:	They were jealous.
Me: 	So that's why they screwed with me?
Kiara:	Umm, I guess...
Kiara:	It wasn't so bad...
Me: 	Maybe for you! The "hot girl" in camp no one could touch.
Kiara:	Hmm, that is true, but...
Me: 	They're the reason I hate this place from the bottom of my soul.
Kiara:	No, you don't...
Me: 	Wanna bet?
Kiara:	How about you just help me clean this cabin?
Me: 	Yay... Making beds for animals. Wooo-hoo...
    Narr:	Still unhappy, you decide to help her...
    Narr:	Still unhappy, you help her, and about twenty minutes later...
Kiara:	Pheew! That should be it!
Me: 	Yeah...
Narr:	With the cabin prepared, you two walk out.
Me: 	*Sigh* Fuck this...
Kiara:	You aren't a kid anymore.
Kiara:	You can hold your ground now.
Me: 	You don't need to tell me that.
Kiara:	Then why are you bitching about it all the time?
Me: 	Damn. Ice-cold...
Kiara:	You really don't wanna be here, huh?
Me: 	Yeah, I really don't.
Kiara:	This year won't be so bad.
Kiara:	I have a feeling the guys will be nice.
Me: 	I bet you do. (Nice and hot, maybe...)
Kiara:	You trying to say something?
Me: 	Nope.
Kiara:	You sure about that?
Me: 	Positive.
Kiara:	Oh, shit...
Me: 	What is it?
Kiara:	I forgot The Guidelines in the house.
Me: 	I'll go get them.
Kiara:	Don't forget, you need to put two in each cabin.
Me: 	I remember, Kiara.
Kiara:	*Chuckle* Sorry for doubting you.
Kiara:	Anyway, I think I left them on the kitchen table.
Me: 	Got it.
hint:	Get the guidelines from the kitchen table.
Me: 	Here they are.
Emily:	Hey, Dennis!
Me: 	Huh?
Emily:	Wanna go for a swim?
Me: 	Oh, umm... I have to--
Emily:	Come on! It's such a nice day!
Me: 	I have to get these--
Emily:	Oh, come on...
Emily:	Pretty please? I wanna try on my new bikini!
Me: 	I can't right--
Emily:	Trust me, you need a swim after such a long trip. *Giggle*
Me: 	*Sigh* Fine, let's go for a swim. (The lake did look refreshing.)
Emily:	Yaaay!
Me: 	But, just a quick dip.
Emily:	Sure.
Me: 	Let me go get my trunks.
Emily:	Hurry up.
Me: 	Yeah, yeah.
Narr:	Going upstairs, you rummage through your stuff and pull out your trunks.
Narr:	Putting them on, you rush back downstairs...
Emily:	Ready?
Me: 	Yeah, let's go.
Emily:	Weee!
Narr:	Together, you make your way towards the lake.
Emily:	Hey! Kiara's here too!
Me: 	(Is she now?)
Emily:	Kiara! Put on some clothes!
Me: 	(Topless?!)
Emily:	Show off!
Emily:	Come on, Dennis, let's go.
Narr:	You and Emily make your way towards the small dock.
Kiara:	What are you two doing here?
Emily:	Going for a swim.
Emily:	What are you doing topless?
Kiara:	Getting a tan.
Me: 	Makes sense.
Emily:	Maybe you should be a bit more careful?
Kiara:	What do you care, you little brat.
Emily:	UGH!!! I told you not to call me that!
Emily:	I'm not a kid anymore! I'm nineteen!
Kiara:	Not being a kid doesn't mean you're not still a brat.
Emily:	UGHH!!!
Me: 	How about we all calm down a little, huh?
Kiara:	I am calm.
Narr:	Saying this, Kiara lies back down on her stomach.
Emily:	Hmph!
Narr:	Not feeling the need to intervene anymore, you start running...
Narr:	And jump into the lake.
Me: 	Ahhh... So refreshing!
Me: 	Come on, Emily!
Emily:	Here I come!
Narr:	She starts running...
Narr:	Jumps...
Narr:	And makes the biggest splash she can.
Kiara:	Ahhh!
Emily:	Oooh! It's cold! Why didn't you warn me?!
Kiara:	What the fuck, Emily?!
Narr:	In her fit of rage, Kiara forgets she's topless.
Me: 	*Gulp*
Emily:	Sorry!
Kiara:	Oh?! (Shit! I'm topless!)
Narr:	Immediately, she lies back down.
Emily:	Won't happen again!
Kiara:	Yeah, yeah, whatever... (I should be more careful.)
Me: 	*Whispers* You did that on purpose, didn't you?
Emily:	*Whispers* Maybe. *Giggle*
Emily:	Brrr! This is too cold for me, I'm getting out.
Me: 	What are you talking about? It's perfect.
Emily:	Yeah, maybe for you.
Me: 	Booo, party pooper...
Narr:	Ignoring you, Emily swims towards the shore...
Narr:	And gets out of the water as soon as she can.
Narr:	Unbeknownst to her, the new bikini she bought becomes a bit see-through when wet.
Emily:	Brrrr...
Narr:	Her nipples, also, got hard from the icy water.
Narr:	Combined with a slightly transparent bikini...
Narr:	It's a view you're not very comfortable seeing.
Emily:	How can you stay in there?
Me: 	It's not so bad. (Oh, fuck... Am I getting hard?)
Me: 	I'm going for a swim. (Gotta get this picture out of my head.)
Emily:	You're crazy!
Me: 	Probably...
Narr:	Trying to "cool off", you start swimming.
Me: 	(What's wrong with me?!)
Me: 	(I got hard by looking Emily's tits?)
Me: 	(And I'm still hard?! What the...)
Me: 	(I mean, it's a normal, physical reaction, right? Right?!)
Me: 	(Just my male brain. It sees boobs and the brain sends a signal...)
Me: 	(Apparently, it doesn't matter whose.)
Me: 	(I mean, what do you expect?)
Me: 	(First I see Kiara topless...)
Me: 	(And then Emily with that see-through bikini...)
Me: 	(Fuck, Dennis! Get it out of your head!)
Narr:	(Still not calm enough, you decide to swim a bit longer.)
Narr:	And a few minutes later...
Narr:	Finally, you swim up to the dock.
Emily:	*Giggle* Your balls freeze off yet?
Me: 	Nah. You coming back in?
Emily:	Not a chance.
Me: 	Weren't you the one who wanted to go swimming?
Emily:	Umm... No, I don't recall saying that. *Giggle*
Me: 	Kiara? What about you?
Kiara:	I'm good.
Me: 	Oh, come on. The water's great, don't listen to Emily.
Kiara:	The weather channel said the next five days will be extremely hot...
Kiara:	Maybe in a day or two, when the water gets a bit warmer.
Kiara:	Besides, I don't even have my swimsuit here.
Me: 	Fine, fine...
Emily:	Say... Dennis?
Me: 	Yeah?
Emily:	You still haven't told me anything about this girl you're seeing.
Kiara:	Oh? So you are seeing someone?
Emily:	What's her name?
Me: 	Jane.
Emily:	Is she hot?
Me: 	Yeah...
Emily:	Hotter than me?
Me: 	Yes.
Emily:	You suuure?
Narr:	You break eye contact as your eyes instinctively move downwards.
Narr:	Unable to speak due to the sight you're witnessing...
Narr:	You simply dive underwater.
Me: 	(Did she... Do that on purpose?)
Me: 	(Is she not aware that her bikini is see-through?!)
Me: 	(Probably not... Yeah, there's no way she did that on purpose.)
Me: 	(Shit, I got hard again... Fuck my brain.)
Me: 	(Ughh... I need air!)
Narr:	Gasping for air, you pop out of the water.
Emily:	*Pout* You didn't even think about it for a second. Just immediately said yes.
Me: 	Umm....
Kiara:	Emily.
Emily:	What?!
Me: 	*Gulp*
Kiara:	You do know that bikini of yours is see-through when it gets wet?
Narr:	Confused, Emily looks down...
Emily:	So? Who cares?
Emily:	I'm not "hot", anyway.
Narr:	Looking pretty pissed, she storms off.
Kiara:	Like I said... Brat.
Kiara:	By the way, you should get out of there before you catch a cold.
Me: 	I'll just stay in here a little longer, don't worry.
Kiara:	Oh? Yeah, sure. (Hmm, I have a hunch about what's going on...)
Me: 	Like I said, it's not that cold.
Kiara:	Whatever you say. (I think we both know why you can't get out.)
Kiara:	I'll leave you to it then...
Kiara:	I'm going inside. Don't wanna get a sunburn.
Me: 	Oh, okay.
Narr:	Making sure to cover her boobs, Kiara starts getting up.
Narr:	Carefully, she turns around...
Narr:	Puts on her shirt...
Narr:	And walks away.
Narr:	As she leaves, you get to the pier.
Me: 	(I better wait a minute or two, until it goes down again... Just to be safe.)
Narr:	And, a minute or two later, you get out of the lake.
Narr:	Taking the towel Kiara left, you dry yourself off.
Me: 	(It felt a little weird wiping myself down with a towel she had under her--)
Me: 	(No, no more thinking about shit like that.)
Me: 	(Anyway, why did Emily just run away?)
Me: 	Hmm... (Is she that insecure about her looks?)
Me: 	(Well, probably... She's only nineteen and still pretty impressionable...)
Me: 	(I should go talk to her, maybe apologize.)
Me: 	(Damn, it's so hot outside...)
Me: 	Fuck, that heat is gonna be the end of me...
Eve:	No swearing under my roof.
Me: 	Maybe you should install an AC unit, because it's hot as hell under "your roof".
Eve:	Sweat builds character.
Me: 	Ugh...
Me: 	Hope you're right.
Eve:	I am.
Narr:	Trying to ignore the unbearable heat, you go upstairs...
Narr:	Finally finding yourself in front of Emily's room.
    Narr:	Finally finding yourself in front of Emily's room.
        Narr:	Without knocking, you open the door and go inside...
        Emily:	Oh!?
        Me: 	*Gulp*
        Narr:	You stand there for a second, staring at Emily's chest.
        Narr:	Finally realizing exactly what you're doing...
        Me: 	Shit! Sorry! (What the hell am I staring at?!)
        Emily:	It's okay. Let me just put my bra on.
        Me: 	Yeah... Sorry, again. (I should've knocked.)
        Emily:	Could you help me with this?
        Me: 	Oh? Umm... I don't know...
        Emily:	Pretty please?
        Me: 	*Sigh* Okay.
        Narr:	Reluctantly, you get behind her and hook her bra together.
        Emily:	Thanks!
        Narr:	Again, your eyes involuntarily move south.
        Me: 	(Fuck off, brain! STOP!)
        Narr:	As you move a step back...
        Narr:	Deciding to be a gentleman, you announce your presence at the door.
        Emily:	Who is it?
        Me: 	It’s me, Em. Can I come in?
        Emily:	If you need to...
Emily:	And? Did you need something?
Me: 	I just wanted to check...
Emily:	Check in on me? Aww, that's sweet!
Me: 	Yeah...
Emily:	Anything else?
Me: 	We good?
Emily:	No. (Did he forget what he said already?)
Me: 	Why not?
Emily:	Because... (Because you said that I'm not hot!)
Emily:	(And I can't have that!)
Narr:	As a thought pops into her head, she sits on her bed.
Emily:	(Hmm... Maybe I could show him how I AM hotter than this "Jane.")
Emily:	Could you help me with something?
Me: 	I guess. What is it?
Emily:	Let me just get something under my bed first.
Narr:	Slowly, she slides onto the floor.
Emily:	(This will be so much fun!)
Emily:	So much stuff down here...
Me: 	*Gulp*
Emily:	Where is it.... (Hope you're getting a good, hard, look!)
Emily:	There you are!
Emily:	Ugh! Shit...
Emily:	Dennis... I think I'm stuck. (Hhh, yeah... So stuck...)
Narr:	Pretending like she's getting out, Emily starts wiggling her ass...
Emily:	Can you help me get out of here, please?
Me: 	Uhh... (Why didn't she put on any pants... That bikini is...)
Emily:	Hello?
Narr:	You cautiously move behind her as she keeps swinging her hips.
Me: 	(She really did grow up.)
Me: 	(I mean, look at that...)
Me: 	(Get those thoughts out of your head, Dennis!)
Narr:	Naturally, you're unable to stop yourself from stiffening up.
Me: 	(Fuck! Not again...)
Emily:	Can you, like... Pull me out or something?
Me: 	Umm... Yeah, sure. (I already lost count of how many erections I had today.)
Me: 	But how?
Emily:	Just grab my hips and pull. Duh!
Me: 	Right.
Narr:	Grabbing her hips...
Narr:	You start pulling.
Emily:	Harder!
Me: 	O-Okay!
Narr:	After a little nudging, Emily is still "stuck".
Emily:	Pull harder!
Me: 	I'm pulling!
Emily:	Ahhh... Harder!
Narr:	Getting a little pissed, you pull with all your strength...
Narr:	Since she wasn't really stuck, just pretending...
Narr:	Your strength surprises her, and she flies out from underneath the bed.
Narr:	As you land on your ass, her ass lands on your... Crotch.
Emily:	Uhh! (Is that his...)
Narr:	For a moment, neither of you move.
Emily:	(He got hard?!)
Narr:	Suddenly, she springs up.
Me: 	(Shit! Did she feel my boner?)
Emily:	Umm, thanks. (So much for not being hot enough, hehehe.)
Narr:	With her confidence back, Emily just sprawls onto her bed.
Me: 	Didn't you need my help with something?
Emily:	Already got it.
Me: 	What? I don't get it.
Emily:	Doesn't matter. (Oh, you're so clueless...)
Me: 	Umm... Okay.
Me: 	Guess I'll leave you to it then.
Emily:	Yeah... Byee!
Me: 	(That was strange...)
Me: 	(Was she... Teasing me?)
Me: 	(Nah. She couldn't have... Why would she do that?)
Narr:	As you're finishing up your inner monologue, Kiara pops out of the bathroom.
Me: 	Oh, hi!
Kiara:	It's so fucking hot in here...
Kiara:	Eve should install an AC...
Kiara:	I just had a shower, and I'm already getting sweaty...
Me: 	"Sweat builds character".
Kiara:	Hah! Bullshit.
Me: 	*Chuckle* (Agreed, bullshit!)
Me: 	Yaaawn... (I'm so tired.)
Me: 	(I only got a few hours of sleep...)
Narr:	With your eyes already closing, you go to your room and get into your bed.
Me: 	(I could take a quick nap.)
Me: 	(Yeah, just to rest my eyes a little...)
Narr:	Finally, exhaustion takes over, and you fall asleep.
Narr:	A few hours later...
Me: 	Hmphh... (It's already dark outside? This was more than a quick nap...)
Narr:	You check your phone and notice that it's 2AM.
Me: 	(Woah! I slept that long? Damn...)
Me: 	(Wonder why no one woke me up for dinner.)
Me: 	(Guess they just didn't wanna bother me.)
Me: 	(How is it still so hot, this late?!
Me: 	*Sigh* (I'll just go grab some water...)
Narr:	Still a little blurry-eyed, you exit your room...
Narr:	Go downstairs...
Narr:	And into the kitchen.
Narr:	After rummaging around the fridge a little, you pour yourself a glass of water.
Me: 	*Glug* *Glug* *Glug*
Me: 	(Blessed be, H2O.)
Me: 	(Okay, back to bed...)
Narr:	As you're leaving the kitchen, you notice Eve coming down the stairs.
Me: 	Hi, Eve.
Eve:	Oh, Dennis! You startled me!
Eve:	What are you doing up?
Me: 	I got thirsty.
Me: 	How come no one woke me up?
Eve:	Sorry, when I saw you sleeping, I didn't want to wake you.
Me: 	Oh, thought so. It's okay.
Me: 	Aaand, why are you still up?
Eve:	Oh... Uhhh...
Eve:	I couldn't sleep, so thought I'd go for a walk.
Me: 	Something bothering you? Want me to come with you?
Eve:	No, no... It's just so hot in here, I could use some air.
Me: 	I get it.
Eve:	Anyway, you should go back to bed. The patients will arrive first thing in the morning.
Me: 	Yes, ma'am. Good night.
Eve:	*Chuckle* Night.
Narr:	Arriving back in your room, it doesn't take long for sleep to take you...
Eve:	Hey.
Me: 	Hmph?
Eve:	Sweetie, wake up.
Me: 	Huh?
Me: 	What time is it?
Eve:	It's 7 AM.
Eve:	Time to wake up.
Me: 	Yeah... (I had such a strange dream...)
Narr:	Still not fully awake, you don't notice the morning wood you currently have.
Narr:	Unlike you, Eve does...
Eve:	Umm... (He's hard again? I should definitely just ignore it.)
Me: 	What's the matter?
Eve:	Oh?! Uhh... Nothing! (How am I supposed to ignore a bulge that big?!)
Me: 	You sure?
Eve:	Yeah, yeah, it's nothing. (It looks so big...)
Eve:	(Now I wonder what it ACTUALLY looks like... Hhh, silly me!)
Me: 	(Why does she keep looking down?)
Narr:	A little confused, you glance where her eyes were "pointing" at...
Me: 	Oh, shit!
Eve:	*Chuckle* Don't worry, it's only natural.
Me: 	Yeah... (Not really! Especially with the dream I had...)
Me: 	(I think the image of her in lingerie got burned into my mind.)
Eve:	Soooo...
Narr:	You interrupt her attempt to change the subject.
Me: 	When are the idiots--sorry, "patients" getting here? (Heh...)
Eve:	Don't call them idiots. They're just, well... unadjusted to the real world.
Eve:	And they need our help.
Me: 	Yeah, I know... (She didn't get the joke...)
Me: 	Fine, when are the PATIENTS getting here?
Eve:	They should be here in an hour or so.
Me: 	Great.
Eve:	I'm going to go make you some breakfast.
Me: 	Awesome! Thanks, Eve.
Eve:	Don't mention it. See you downstairs.
Me: 	See ya'.
Narr:	As she leaves, you get up and get dressed.
Narr:	Leaving your room...
Narr:	You make your way towards the bathroom.
    Narr:	You make your way towards the bathroom.
        Narr:	*Knock* *Knock*
        Kiara:	Occupied!
        Me: 	You done soon? Gotta pee!
        Kiara:	I'm in the shower, I'll be done in a few minutes.
        Me: 	Okay.
        Narr:	With nothing else to do, you wait in front of the bathroom for a few minutes.
        Narr:	Soon after, Kiara opens the door, wearing nothing but her lingerie.
        Narr:	Racy lingerie, at that.
        Kiara:	Oh?! You're still here?!
        Me: 	*Gulp* I told you, I gotta pee... (What is she wearing?!)
        Kiara:	Well, don't just stand there, go pee.
        Kiara:	(I'll have to get used to him being around... Should've taken some clothes to the bathroom with me.)
        Me: 	Oh, right! Going! Sorry, I'm still a little sleepy.
        Kiara:	Riiight... (Wait, was he checking me out?)
        Kiara:	(Hah! Can't really blame him.)
        Narr:	Covered up a lot less than she maybe should be, Kiara strolls towards her room.
            Narr:	Covered up a lot less than she maybe should be, Kiara strolls towards her room.
                Narr:	Unable to control yourself, you turn your head...
                Me: 	(Why is she walking around dressed like that?)
                Me: 	(Isn't it a bit too revealing?)
                Narr:	Kiara enters her room, but looks at you for a bit before closing the door.
                Me: 	(Fuck, I hope she didn't notice...)
                Narr:	Pretending nothing happened...
        Narr:	Forgetting to knock first, you open the door...
        Kiara:	Eeek!
        Me: 	Shit! Sorry!
        Narr:	Almost instantly, you turn around.
        Kiara:	What the hell, Dennis?!
        Me: 	Sorry! I didn't think it was occupied.
        Kiara:	*Sigh* Learn to knock.
        Me: 	I really had to pee.
        Me: 	Why didn't you just lock the door?
        Kiara:	I didn't expect someone would come in without knocking.
        Me: 	You're right, my bad. Won't happen again.
        Kiara:	It doesn't matter now. Mind going outside so I can get dressed?
        Me: 	Right! Sure!
        Narr:	Obediently, you leave the bathroom.
        Me: 	(Really should have knocked...)
        Me: 	(I'll just wait in my room until she's finished.)
        Narr:	A few minutes pass...
        Narr:	You hear Kiara walking down the hall and the sound of her bedroom door closing.
Narr:	You go inside the bathroom.
Me: 	Ahhh...
    Narr:	Suddenly, you hear the door swing open...
    Me: 	Gaahhh!
    Narr:	Kiara's jump-scare makes you piss all over your leg.
    Kiara:	Hah! See? Not cool.
    Me: 	I pissed all over myself!
    Kiara:	Sorry!
    Kiara:	Byee!
    Me: 	What the hell, Kiara?!
    Kiara:	I said, sorry! (I didn't expect he'd still be taking a piss...)
    Me: 	Not cool! Not cool at all!
    Kiara:	Well, think of it as getting a taste of your own medicine.
    Kiara:	You'll get over it. (Dennis is hung? Like, really hung?! Since when?!)
    Me: 	(Now I have to take a shower...)
    Narr:	You go to your room for a fresh change of clothes.
    Narr:	After a quick shower, you get dressed...
    Me: 	(Hope they won't be complete idiots.)
    Me: 	(But I'd say that's just wishful thinking.)
    Me: 	(The amount of stupidity in the world is only increasing...)
    Me: 	(So... Guess I'm fucked...)
    Me: 	(Oh, well... Better just accept my fate...)
    Me: 	(...)
    Me: 	(Hmmm...)
    Me: 	(Maybe plants really ARE farming us...)
    Me: 	(Giving us oxygen until we eventually drop dead, turning into mulch they can consume...)
    Me: 	(...)
    Me: 	(This is really taking a while...)
    Me: 	(...)
    Me: 	(Finally...)
    Narr:	Zipping up your pants...
    Narr:	You wash your hands.
Narr:	And leave the bathroom.
Me: 	(Damn... It's already getting pretty hot...)
Narr:	Making your way downstairs...
Narr:	Eve suddenly pops out from around the corner.
Eve:	Could you please go and wake Emily up?
Me: 	Sure.
Narr:	Seconds later, you're outside her room.
Narr:	Gently, you knock on the door.
Me: 	Emily?
Narr:	No answer...
Me: 	Emily!
Narr:	Again, no answer...
Me: 	I'm coming in.
Narr:	Opening the door, you notice Emily lying on her back, her bedsheets all over the floor.
Me: 	(Shit! Her boob fell out of her bra!)
Narr:	From downstairs, you hear Eve yelling...
Eve:	Did you wake her up?!
Me: 	Working on it!
Me: 	Emily!
Me: 	(You gotta be kidding me...)
Narr:	Unsure if it's a good idea, you walk closer to her.
Me: 	Emily, wake up!
Narr:	No response...
Me: 	Ugh!
Me: 	(What do I do?)
    Me: 	(What do I do?)
        Me: 	(Should probably fix her bra before waking her up.)
        Me: 	(I really hope she doesn't wake up...)
        Narr:	You move your hand closer...
        Narr:	Gently grab her bra...
        Narr:	And pull it up.
        Emily:	Mmmm...
        Narr:	Finally, you poke her forehead.
        Me: 	Wake up!
        Emily:	Mmmmm...
        Emily:	Hmph...
        Me: 	Time to wake up...
        Emily:	Wha... Already?
        Me: 	Umm... Yeah.
        Emily:	What time is it?
        Me: 	It is--was 7 AM, about twenty minutes ago.
        Me: 	Breakfast will be ready soon.
        Emily:	Ughhh...
        Emily:	It's too early...
        Me: 	Yeah, yeah. See ya' downstairs.
        Emily:	*Yawn* Yeah...
        Narr:	With that, you leave her bedroom.
        Narr:	You poke her forehead.
        Me: 	Wake up!
        Emily:	Mmmmm...
        Emily:	Hmph...
        Me: 	Time to wake up...
        Emily:	Wha... Already?
        Me: 	Umm... Yeah.
        Emily:	What time is it?
        Me: 	It is--was 7 AM, twenty minutes ago.
        Me: 	Breakfast will be ready soon.
        Emily:	Ughhh...
        Emily:	It's too early...
        Narr:	Instinctively, your eyes jump towards her chest.
        Me: 	(Do I say something?)
        Me: 	(Nah, I don't wanna make a big deal out of it. Better just leave...)
        Me: 	See ya' downstairs.
        Emily:	Yawn! Yeah...
        Narr:	With that, you leave her bedroom.
        Emily:	(Oh? Did my boob fall out while I was sleeping?)
        Emily:	(Why didn't he say anything?)
        Emily:	*Giggle* (He probably just wanted to stare at it... Pervert.)
        Emily:	(Oh, well... "Oopsy".)
Narr:	Trying not to think about what just happened, you make your way down the stairs...
Narr:	And into the kitchen.
Eve:	Did you wake Emily up?
Me: 	Yeah...
Me: 	Is there any coffee?
Eve:	Huh?
Me: 	What?
Eve:	Since when do you drink coffee?
Me: 	Since I'm in college and have to study all night long.
Eve:	*Chuckle* Okay, coffee it is. (He's so grown up...)
Narr:	She pours you a cup.
Eve:	Here you go. Careful, it's hot.
Me: 	Thanks, Eve.
Me: 	Hey, Eve, I'm not that hungry. I'll just go chill on the couch.
Eve:	But...
Me: 	I'll eat later. Don't worry.
Narr:	As you sit down...
Narr:	You hear Emily yell from upstairs.
Emily:	I think I can see them!
Narr:	Everyone gathers in front of the house, waiting for the van.
Kiara:	Didn't you say they were here?
Emily:	I meant, any second now.
Kiara:	So where are they?
Eve:	I think I can hear the van.
Me: 	(I hope there aren't more than five idiots aboard.)
Narr:	The van doors open.
Me: 	(Here we go... What do we have first... An animal abuser?)
Me: 	(Perhaps a dendrophile...)
Me: 	(Maybe a...)
Me: 	(Whaaa?!)
Me: 	(I-It's a...)
Me: 	(Girl?!)
Narr:	Before your brain has time to even process what just happened...
Me: 	(Another girl?!)
Me: 	(This is, umm... Unexpected!)
Me: 	(Holy shit! Another one?!)
Me: 	(Is that it? No guys this year? How?! Why?!)
Narr:	The girls line up next to the van...
Kiara:	(What the fuck?!)
Emily:	(Weee! So cool!)
Eve:	(This year will be different, that's for sure.)
Me: 	(This is gonna be interesting...)
Narr:	Eve takes a step forward.
Eve:	Hello, girls. Welcome to Camp Red Falls.
noname:	Hi!
Eve:	I'm doctor Daniels. And I will be your caretaker for the duration of your stay here.
Eve:	You can go unpack first. Once you're done, we'll meet in front of your residences.
Eve:	Take the girls to their cabins.
Me: 	Umm, yeah! Sure.
Me: 	So... Please come with me!
Me: 	(Well, this is unexpected...)
Me: 	(How come we only have female patients this year?)
Narr:	As the girls follow you, you give them the basic tour of the place...
Me: 	This is the main building... That's where the staff sleeps.
Me: 	Over yonder is our community house...
Me: 	You'll have private and group sessions there, among other things.
Me: 	The lake is clean, and you can swim in it whenever you have time off.
Me: 	And...
Naomi:	Hey, I'm Naomi, and you're kinda hot.
Naomi:	Are you also a patient? (Dibs, I saw him first!)
Me: 	Uhh, no... I work here... (Did she just call me "hot"?)
Naomi:	So, you'll be around?
Me: 	Yeah, I'll be around. But I can't--
Naomi:	Great! Then we'll get to know each other better. You'll love my company, I'm sure.
Me: 	Aha, right... (Who is this chick? She starts hitting on me the moment she arrives?)
Me: 	(I mean, not that it doesn't build up my ego a little... She's smoking hot, but...)
Me: 	*Sigh* (Guess you can't expect normal behavior in this damn place.)
Me: 	(They are getting rehabilitated, after all...)
Me: 	(This one's probably a nymphomaniac or some shit like that.)
Naomi:	Something wrong? You don't enjoy my company?
Me: 	No, no, nothing like that. I just...
Naomi:	Duuuh... Of course you enjoy my company. I mean, who doesn't?
Me: 	(Not a nympho, but a fucking narcissist...)
Me: 	*Nervous chuckle* Yeah, must be it... (How self-absorbed can you get?)
Naomi:	So... I was thinking. Why don't you show me around later? Give me a private tour, hmm?
Violet:	Naomi, you can't talk to the staff like that... (I mean, he is cute, but still...)
Naomi:	Maybe you can't, fatty.
Naomi:	Who are you to tell me what I can or can't do, huh?!
Violet:	I didn't mean...
Naomi:	Just shut up, Violet! Ugh, all brawn, no brain...
Belle:	*Chuckle* Not even five minutes in, and they're already bickering like children...
Stacy:	Indeed...
Belle:	So? What are you in here for?
Stacy:	Fire.
Belle:	Ooh, a matchstick enthusiast! We'll have so much fun!
Belle:	Tell me what happened.
Stacy:	I... May have gone overboard while recruiting followers.
Belle:	"Followers"?
Stacy:	Yes, the Puncturing Flame.
Belle:	And what's that?
Stacy:	It's a religion. In short, we worship fire and its beauty.
Stacy:	Interested? Would you consider joining us?
Belle:	Ah, I see... S-Sounds interesting, I'll think about it.
Belle:	(Oh God, I can't believe I'm in the same boat as these weirdos...)
Stacy:	*Sniff* *Sniff* Do I smell BBQ? Where's the campfire?
Violet:	At least I'm not an empty, manipulative bitch!
Naomi:	Wanna repeat that, fatty?!
Me: 	LADIES, ENOUGH!
Narr:	As you raise your voice, all of them freeze up.
Me: 	Good. Let's get you settled, then.
Me: 	You'll have plenty of time to rip each other's throats out during your stay.
Me: 	Moving on... These are your new homes.
Me: 	You'll each be sharing one with another person.
Naomi:	Share? But there are three cabins, why can't I go solo in the third cabin?
Me: 	Because it's good practice. Getting to know one another, sharing the rehabilitation experience...
Naomi:	Fucking stupid... I want my own place.
Me: 	It's also because those are the rules. (Shit! I forgot about the guidelines completely.)
Stacy:	Calm down, Naomi. You cannot escape the prophecy, anyway.
Naomi:	*Grumble* Fine! I'm taking that one!
Naomi:	Come, Stacy, you should join me. You seem like a fun roomie, unlike fatty here...
Stacy:	Sure. I do not believe the Pheonix-Lotus would mind.
Me: 	("Prophecy"? "Phoenix-Lotus"? What the fuck is she talking about?)
Me: 	Anyway, it's unlocked. Keys are in the lock, on the inside.
Me: 	Take your time and get settled.
Narr:	Without delay, Naomi briskly goes towards the cabin, with Stacy following suit.
Belle:	Guess that leaves us two. (At least I'm not grouped with that flame-natic.)
Violet:	Yeah, okay...
Belle:	You gonna pick us up later?
Belle:	(Hmm, Naomi sure knows how to quickly separate the wheat from the chaff, he is quite handsome...)
Me: 	Probably, but you have time to get comfortable until then.
Belle:	Oh, lovely. Well, can't wait to see you again.
Me: 	("Can't wait to see me"?)
Narr:	Somewhat dumbfounded by her choice of words, you just stand there.
Narr:	Wondering if this girl just hit on you as well.
Me: 	*Sigh* (It's gonna be a long-ass summer...)
Me: 	(I better go get The Guidelines from my room.)
Narr:	Finally managing to squeeze some words out...
Me: 	Umm, yeah... Bye.
Belle:	Byee!
tut:	The diary will help you remember all the girls and events happening in the camp.
tut:	Info about all the girls you meet can also be found here!
tut:	Yellow Post-It note in the bottom-right corner is the synopsis tab.
tut:	After a day ends, you can read a general recap, reminding you of all you've done.
tut:	As the days pass, recap of each will be added to this tab..
tut:	Each girl in Helping the Hotties has a diary page about them.
tut:	As the story progresses, each decision that involves an individual girl, can be found on her diary page.
tut:	If you forget what happened, this feature should help you keep track of the story and its developments.
tut:	Additionally, as you progress, each girl’s page will have new images unlocked.
tut:	Achievements and missions can be accessed by clicking the stars icon, under the diary icon.
tut:	Achievements have a progress bar, and a hint on how to complete an achievement is listed below the achievement name.
tut:	Once you fully complete the progress bar for an achievement, click the "collect" button to the right of the achievement.
tut:	This will allow you to collect the reward for that achievement, which is viewable in the gallery.
tut:	The achievements you have completed are marked by the crown, once you claim the reward tied to that achievement.
    Me: 	(Where should I go?)
        Me: 	(Where should I go?)
Me: 	(A key? Wonder what it opens...)
Me: 	(Guess I'll find out soon enough.)
    Me: 	(I haven't seen Kiara since the patients arrived. She must be holed-up in her room.)
    Narr:	Approaching her room, you knock.
    Me: 	Kiara, you here?
    Narr:	Not hearing a response, you open the door...
    Narr:	And enter her room.
    Me: 	Kiara? (Where the hell is she?)
Me: 	(A notebook?)
Me: 	(No, it's Kiara's diary?!)
    Me: 	(No, it's Kiara's diary?!)
        Me: 	(It's Kiara's diary. I wonder what she wrote...)
        Me: 	(Maybe she mentioned me...)
        Me: 	(We're still somewhat distant because of that one time...)
        Me: 	(Maybe I can find out how she feels.)
        Me: 	...
        Me: 	(Well, Kiara, it's your fault for leaving it out in the open like this...)
        Me: 	(It's like you want someone to read it.)
        Narr:	You pick up her diary and begin flipping through its pages.
        Narr:	The pages are mostly filled with uneventful days spent at Red Falls...
        Narr:	Some mentions of Eve, but nothing out of the ordinary.
        Me: 	(This was a few years back. Just before college...)
        Narr:	At last, you notice a passage with your name in it.
        Narr:	("Fateful night"?! "All these feelings"?!...)
        Me: 	(Does Kiara still have a thing for me? But she also says she'd like it if things returned to normal...)
        Me: 	Fuck... (Maybe I shouldn't have read this.)
        Me: 	(Now I have to make sure she doesn't notice anything weird about my behavior.)
        Me: 	*Sigh* Problem after problem, huh?
        Narr:	You place the diary back in the same position as when you found it.
        Narr:	You learned more than you hoped for, perhaps even more than you wished for...
        Narr:	But, nonetheless, you got some juicy info out of it. 
        Me: 	(I better leave the room. Don't wanna get caught with my pants down...)
        Narr:	Before anyone sees you, you leave Kiara's room.
        Me: 	(It is quite tempting, but...)
        Me: 	(I really shouldn't read her diary, even though I'm curious as hell.)
        Me: 	(I might find out something I'd rather not know...)
        Narr:	Not wanting to get caught, you leave Kiara's journal alone.
Me: 	(Hey! That's a photo with all of us!)
Me: 	(I should get a copy made, too.)
Me: 	(Everyone looks so happy.)
Me: 	(Eve looks gorgeous...)
Me: 	(Kiara and Emily too.)
Narr:	And then it hits you...
Me: 	(Wait, where am I?!)
Me: 	I'm not in the photo...
Me: 	(SERIOUSLY?! I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT IN THE PHOTO?!)
Me: 	(But how? Why? When was this taken?)
Me: 	(By the look of their clothes, it was definitely taken during the summer. Probably at Red Falls, too.)
Me: 	(It doesn't say...)
Me: 	(The time stamp must be on the back of the picture.)
Me: 	(I'll have to open up the frame somehow, if I wanna get to the bottom of this.)
    Me: 	(I'll have to open up the frame somehow, if I wanna get to the bottom of this.)
        Me: 	(As much as I'd like to know why...)
        Me: 	(It's probably best to remain ignorant.)
        Me: 	(Not to mention, if Kiara finds out I've been snooping around her room, she'll strangle me in my sleep.)
        Me: 	(I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation as to why I'm not "part of the gang"...)
        Me: 	(I can't just let this slide. I at least gotta know when it was taken.)
        Narr:	Poking around a little, you try opening the picture's frame.
        Me: 	(It's stuck...)
        Me: 	(Fine, I'll just claw my way in.)
        Narr:	*Snap*
        Me: 	Perfect... (I broke it...)
        Me: 	(At least it's on the back side. Hope she doesn't notice.)
        Me: 	*Sigh* (What's done is done. Might as well find out...)
        Me: 	("August"? Two years ago?)
        Me: 	(That's when I started college, right? And before that...)
        Me: 	(Before that, Kiara and I...)
        Me: 	(Shit. I just left after creating so much chaos...)
        Me: 	(No wonder I'm not in the photo.)
        Me: 	(No wonder Kiara's been acting weird.)
Me: 	(Is that what I think it is?)
Narr:	You crouch down to take a closer look.
Me: 	(It really is my old volleyball!)
Me: 	(Wow, she still has it after all this time.)
Me: 	(Aww, man. I'd love to play again.)
Me: 	(I still remember that time we played... All those girls in swimwear, jumping around, sweating...)
Me: 	(Wait, Kiara was also there with me! That's right, we played on the same team.)
Me: 	Huh... (She looked amazing...)
Me: 	(We've had a lot of good memories together, haven't we?)
Me: 	(I just hope she thinks of them as fondly as I do.)
Me: 	(Her perfume bottles.)
Me: 	(Looks expensive...)
Me: 	(I doubt she bought them all by herself...)
Me: 	(Wouldn't be surprised if she got one from a previous patient or something like that.)
Me: 	(Do I...)
    Me: 	(Do I...)
        Me: 	(Yeeeeah, I'd rather not...)
        Me: 	(Snooping around her room is weird enough as it is.)
        Me: 	(No need to sniff a girl's perfume like some creep.)
        Me: 	...
        Me: 	(Shit, Jane was right... Maybe I am a creep.)
        Me: 	Ah, well...
Me: 	*Sniff* *Sniff*
Me: 	Ahhhhh... (Smells wonderful.)
Me: 	(Just like Kiara...)
Me: 	...
Me: 	*Cough* (I should probably put that back.)
Me: 	(Haven't been in her room for years...)
Me: 	(I wonder if anything's changed.)
Narr:	Without much thought, you try opening the door...
Me: 	Hmm, locked. (Now I'm even more curious.)
Me: 	(Wait, maybe that key...)
Narr:	Cautious not to make too much noise...
Narr:	You insert the key into the lock and turn it.
Me: 	(Lucky me, it's the right one.)
Narr:	You open the door and walk into the bedroom.
Me: 	Hmm... Looks more or less how I remember. (Not sure what I was expecting...)
Me: 	(Maybe the key's just for privacy's sake, 'cause of the patients and all.)
Me: 	(Well, can't hurt to look around.)
    Me: 	(Hmm, nothing interesting in here.)
    Me: 	(Emily?)
    Me: 	(Looks like she's talking to one of the patients. Wonder what it's about...)
    Me: 	(She seems really into it...)
    Me: 	Huh. (Guess Emily picked up some social skills while working here.)
    Me: 	(What's that?)
    Me: 	(A box? Not sure if I wanna know the contents...)
    Me: 	Ehh, might as well.
    Narr:	You pull the box out.
    Me: 	(What's behind door number one?)
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	(I'm not sure what I expected to find in a box hidden under the bed...)
    Me: 	(Oh, God. I can feel the mental scars growing.)
        Me: 	(What's that sound outside?)
Me: 	(Haven't been in her room for years...)
Me: 	(I wonder if anything's changed.)
Narr:	Without much thought, you try opening the door...
Me: 	Hmm, locked. (Now I'm even more curious.)
Me: 	(I'll have to find the key somewhere.)
Me: 	(Asking for it would probably sound weird.)
Narr:	As you enter the kitchen, you notice Kiara hanging around.
    Me: 	Hey, Kiara.
    Kiara:	Hi, have you finished your chores?
    Me: 	Yeah, the girls are getting settled in.
    Kiara:	And The Guidelines?
    Me: 	Uhhhhhh...
    Kiara:	*Chuckle* Don't worry, I won't bite.
    Kiara:	Just make sure to give a copy to every patient.
    Kiara:	Well, I have some shit to do, I'll talk to you later.
    Me: 	'Kay, later.
    Me: 	(Shit, it's Kiara. I better not slip up.)
    Kiara:	Eeeek! Oh, it's you... You scared me. (Still not used to him popping up.)
    Me: 	My bad.
    Kiara:	What are you skulking around the house for?
    Me: 	Oh, ummm, nothing. Just wandering around, that's all.
    Kiara:	Mhm, I bet. (He's hiding something...)
    Me: 	Really!
    Kiara:	You know I've been working here for years, right? I can tell when something's up.
    Me: 	(She doesn't believe me... I'll have to come up with a better excuse.)
    Kiara:	Hellooo?
        Kiara:	Hellooo?
            Me: 	You don't look too cheery. Something wrong?
            Kiara:	Hmm, can't hide anything from you, can I?
            Me: 	You read me, I read you..
            Kiara:	*Sigh* Yeah, I guess something's wrong.
            Kiara:	Nothing serious, but annoying, nonetheless.
            Me: 	What about?
            Kiara:	Don't you worry your pretty little head. I'll manage.
            Me: 	You can tell me if something's bothering you. I'll listen.
            Kiara:	I know you would.
            Kiara:	Maybe I'll even take you up on that offer, but another time. Okay?
            Me: 	Whenever you need me.
            Kiara:	I'm glad you're here. I missed you.
            Me: 	I missed you too.
            Narr:	You sit there for a moment, exchanging looks in silence.
            Kiara:	Right, ummm...
            Me: 	Okay, good talk.
            Kiara:	*Chuckle* Yeah, I have some shit to do anyway, I'll see you later.
            Me: 	Later, Kiara.
            Narr:	With that, she leaves the kitchen.
            Me: 	(Phew, that was a close one.)
            Me: 	Ohhh... Uhhh... Ummm... Ehhh... (Fuck, I can't come up with anything on the spot.)
            Kiara:	I think I know what this is about. (He's still thinking about it...)
            Kiara:	I tried to put it in the past, but I see you're still struggling to do the same.
            Me: 	No, it's not about... (Hit the nail on the head. You're too good at this, Kiara...)
            Kiara:	Spare me. I can see you cringing anxiously around me...
            Kiara:	There's only one reason...
            Me: 	...
            Kiara:	I thought you had grown up, maybe I was wrong.
            Me: 	Kiara, I...
            Kiara:	It's fine. I was naïve thinking everything would return to how it once was.
            Kiara:	I'm ready to let go, but I shouldn't just expect you to do the same.
            Me: 	Kiara, stop!
            Narr:	Raising your voice catches her off-guard.
            Me: 	Yes, it crosses my mind here and there, but I don't care about that anymore.
            Me: 	We've known each other forever, for fuck's sake.
            Me: 	And seeing how you're still bringing it up doesn't really give off the impression of coming to grips with it.
            Kiara:	What would you know about anything? About me?
            Kiara:	You left for college, didn't even call or anything.
            Kiara:	If it weren't for Christmas, I probably wouldn't have seen you at all!
            Me: 	*Sigh* I did kind of run away, didn't I?
            Me: 	But I'm here now, and I'm tired of avoiding you.
            Me: 	I want our relationship to be normal, "like it was".
            Kiara:	We'll see about that...
            Kiara:	Oh, and Dennis... I hope you really mean what you're saying.
            Narr:	Without uttering another word, Kiara walks away.
            Me: 	*Sigh* Fuck... (It's still bothering her. Can't say I don't feel the same...)
Me: 	(I've wasted enough time already... I should just get the guidelines before anyone notices.)
Me: 	Ah, there they are. (Thought for a second I lost them.)
Narr:	You take another look at the papers...
Me: 	Hmm... (They haven't changed much.)
Me: 	(Same old crappy guidelines that mostly protect the institution, not the patients, blah-blah-blah...)
Me: 	Oh? (There are a few new ones I haven't seen before...)
Me: 	"Romantic relations are strictly forbidden", "All personnel must not become emotionally attached to patients"...
Me: 	(What the fuck is this? New rules? And pretty obvious ones at that...)
Me: 	(Did something happen? Maybe that's the reason why all the patients are female this time.)
Me: 	(I'll ask Eve about it.)
Narr:	After going through the guidelines again, you leave to distribute them.
Narr:	Walking down the stairs, you bump into Eve.
Narr:	Definitely not wanting her to notice the guidelines being delivered just now, you hide them behind your back...
Eve:	Have you finished everything I asked?
Me: 	Uh-huh...
Eve:	And the patients are in their designated cabins?
Me: 	"Designated"? I just brought them there, no one told me anything about "designated rooms".
Eve:	Of course they have designated rooms, what did you expect?
Me: 	I didn't think it was that important...
Me: 	I'll go deal with it right away.
Eve:	Oh, and...
Me: 	What?
Eve:	Those guidelines you're hiding should've been in their rooms before the patients got here...
Me: 	...
Me: 	*Sigh* (They've probably already settled in. This is gonna be a pain...)
Me: 	(Where do I even go first?)
Narr:	A little hesitant, you head towards the cabins...
    Narr:	You approach the first cabin...
    Narr:	As you get closer, you hear voices from inside.
    Naomi:	No, no, no! I told you, like, five times already, be careful with that and put the lighter away!
    Narr:	You knock on the door.
    Stacy:	I doubt the Phoenix-Lotus cares about such trivialities...
    Naomi:	These "trivialities" are worth more than your whole family's net worth!
    Narr:	You knock again.
    Naomi:	And what the fuck is a "Phoenix-Lotus", anyway?!
    Naomi:	Your deity obviously doesn't have a sense of fashion!
    Naomi:	Can't tell the difference between a dress and a top?
    Stacy:	The Phoenix-Lotus surely has a more refined fashion taste than you...
    Naomi:	Are you seriou--
    Narr:	Everything goes quiet for a brief moment...
    Narr:	Before the door swings open.
    Narr:	With Naomi standing on the other side of the threshold.
    Naomi:	Sorry, handsome, but not right now. We're busy.
    Me: 	Hey, can I borrow you for a second?
    Naomi:	Mmmm, couldn't wait, could you? (Of course. How could he resist?)
    Me: 	That's not...
    Naomi:	Alright, guess I have a minute... (I should do my research, anyway.)
    Me: 	I came to give you these guidelines.
    Naomi:	Oh, wonderful...
    Me: 	*Sigh* And... I'll have to ask one of you to move.
    Narr:	The moment she hears this, Naomi's flirty behavior shifts to annoyance...
    Naomi:	Excuse me? Why?
    Me: 	The sleeping arrengements were predetermined, it seems.
    Naomi:	What does that even mean?
    Me: 	It means you have to swap roomies.
    Naomi:	Why?! That's such a waste of time. Plus, I don't want to.
    Naomi:	I'm fine with Stacy... Even though she's...
    Naomi:	Well, the way she is.
    Me: 	I'm not the one calling the shots, sorry.
    Naomi:	I literally unpacked this second.
    Me: 	(As far as I could tell, Stacy unpacked your shit while you were giving orders.)
    Me: 	Again, sorry for the inconvenience, I wasn't briefed about it.
    Naomi:	*Tsk* Very unprofessional...
    Me: 	*Sigh* Tell me about it.
    Naomi:	Hmm... (I was expecting him to get all defensive, but he just agreed. He's not even sarcastic.)
    Naomi:	You can ask Stacy if she's willing to move.
    Naomi:	'Cause I'm definitely not moving an inch.
    Naomi:	Who am I paired up with, anyway?
    Naomi:	I hope it's not that gorilla.
    Me: 	If you mean Violet, I'm afraid it is.
    Naomi:	HUH?! That makes no sense!
    Naomi:	We're total opposites, how is that supposed to work?!
    Me: 	I told you, I'm not the one calling the shots...
    Me: 	Plus, you two might have more in common than you think.
    Naomi:	That's fucking bullshit, I'm not doing it.
    Me: 	You're here for rehabilitation, not a vacation.
    Me: 	Going out of your comfort zone might actually do you good.
    Narr:	Naomi looks annoyed, but remains silent.
    Narr:	Whether she saw logic in your words or you struck a nerve, she stops complaining.
    Naomi:	Fine... But Stacy is the one moving. I'm staying here. (Again with the fucking "comfort zone"...)
    Me: 	It's all the same to me. I'll leave you two to figure it out.
    Naomi:	Dennis!
    Me: 	Yeah?
    Naomi:	Do you have a girlfriend?
    Me: 	Huh? Why do you ask? (A little too upfront, but okay...)
    Naomi:	I'm just curious. (Plus, I'm interested in what type of prey I'm dealing with.)
    Me: 	Lookin' to apply for the position?
    Narr:	Your words catch Naomi off-guard, causing her to blush a little.
    Naomi:	No, don't be so full of yourself.
    Me: 	*Chuckle* If you must know, though. Yes, I'm seeing someone.
    Me: 	You know, we're having fun.
    Naomi:	Good for you. (He's perrrfect!)
    Naomi:	Bye now.
    Me: 	Sorry, I still need to talk to Stacy for a moment.
    Naomi:	...
    Naomi:	Humph...
    Narr:	After a brief second, she moves out of the way and lets you enter.
    Stacy:	Hello, sir. Have you come to join The Puncturing Flame?
    Me: 	Uhh, no, not right now.
    Stacy:	Shame... We could use more people with good genes like yourself.
    Me: 	("Genes"?! The fuck is she talking about?)
    Me: 	Yeah, maybe some other time.
    Stacy:	Alright, we'll wait until the flame calls to you.
    Me: 	Umm... Yeeeaahhh...
    Me: 	So, there was a misunderstanding with the housing.
    Me: 	You should've been paired with Belle, doctor's orders.
    Stacy:	I see... Yes, there were signs around her, should've expected this.
    Me: 	Yeeeaahhh, ummm... Can you maybe move your stuff over to the other cabin?
    Stacy:	I doubt Naomi's the type that pleases others, so...
    Stacy:	I'll comply.
    Me: 	Excellent, glad you're so... cooperative.
    Stacy:	Of course, cooperation is the first step in leading a successful flock.
    Me: 	Right... (A "flock"?! The hell?!)
    Me: 	Anyway, take this... House rules and guidelines. Read them.
    Stacy:	Awww, thank you! This will prove excellent kindling.
    Me: 	Yeeeaahhh, try to read it before you burn it.
    Stacy:	*Giggle* I can't promise anything.
    Me: 	Alright, I'll be around if you need help.
    Stacy:	May The Charred Kings lead your way.
    Me: 	Yeeeaahhh, I'll follow them wherever...
    Naomi:	You finally done?
    Me: 	Yeah, all done. I'll see you later.
    Naomi:	Take care, handsome.
    Me: 	"Handsome"?
    Naomi:	Surprised? You shouldn't be.
    Me: 	*Chuckle* (Hasn't heard of subtlety, has she?)
    Narr:	As you turn around to answer...
    Narr:	You notice Stacy lying on her bed.
    Me: 	(Whoa!)
    Me: 	(I can see under Stacy's skirt!)
    Me: 	(Holy shit, she's not wearing any underwear!)
    Me: 	(Fuck, I shouldn't be looking at that!)
    Me: 	(I really gotta stop getting myself in these situations...)
    Narr:	Finally, you leave their cabin.
    Narr:	You approach the second cabin...
    Narr:	And knock on the door.
    Me: 	(No one's answering, are they even inside?)
    Narr:	Leaning towards the door...
    Narr:	You take a peek.
    Narr:	Immediately noticing one of the girls inside, getting undressed.
    Me: 	(Holy shit! She's half naked!)
    Me: 	(Wow, nice tits...)
    Me: 	(I really shouldn't, though...)
    Me: 	...
    Me: 	(I better move. If she sees me, all hell will break loose.)
    Me: 	(I'll just knock on the door a bit harder, this time.)
    Narr:	Making sure not to overdo it, you bang on the door.
    Narr:	After a few seconds...
    Belle:	Just a second!
    Narr:	One of the girls greets you on the doorstep.
    Belle:	Yes?
    Me: 	Hello, hope I'm not intruding.
    Belle:	Not at all, come in, come in.
    Belle:	I'm Belle, by the way.
    Me: 	(Oh, right. We never got a chance to properly meet.)
    Me: 	Dennis.
    Belle:	How can I help, Dennis?
    Me: 	There was a misunderstanding with the cabins.
    Belle:	What do you mean?
    Me: 	Nothing serious, but you'll have to swap roomies.
    Belle:	Oh, okay. So? Who should I pair up with?
    Me: 	The religious one, Stacy.
    Belle:	Ahh, okay... Should I stay here or move? (Just hope I won't wake up on fire...)
        Me: 	You stay here, she'll move in with you.
        Me: 	Doesn't matter, you can figure it out later, but you should be staying with her.
    Belle:	Okay, I don't mind.
    Me: 	Oh, right. Almost forgot to give you this...
    Belle:	What is it?
    Me: 	Just The Guidelines. You should read them.
    Narr:	After a quick look...
    Belle:	"Romantic relationships are strictly forbidden", "All personnel must not become emotionally attached to patients"...
    Me: 	Yeah, those are new. Not sure how or why those happened, but...
    Belle:	Guess your hands are tied then... Too bad. (Huh, I smell a challenge.)
    Me: 	First off, I'm seeing someone...
    Me: 	Second, I shouldn't even have to mention how "irregular" it is for patients to have intimate relationships with their doctors.
    Belle:	Oh? You're a doctor, Dennis?
    Me: 	No, but that--
    Belle:	Then why trouble yourself, if it doesn't affect you?
    Me: 	The Guidelines say "personnel", not "doctors". Rules apply to all.
    Belle:	*Giggle* I won't tell if you won't...
    Me: 	*Sigh* (Who the hell are these chicks?)
    Me: 	Hmm, I just noticed...
    Me: 	Where's the purple-haired one, uhh...
    Belle:	You mean, Violet? Said she needed some fresh air.
    Belle:	Sports type, can't hold still for five minutes...
    Belle:	Hasn't even unpacked. *Chuckle*
    Me: 	Okay, I'll go look for her. Thanks.
    Belle:	Don't mention it. You should come and visit more often. *Wink*
    Me: 	I'll think about it. (Jesus, am I seeing things or are they all hitting on me? Is that the reason they're here?)
    Me: 	(She said that Violet went outside...)
    Narr:	Looking around, you spot Violet doing some stretches.
    Narr:	Coming closer, you see that she's quite fit.
    Narr:	Surprisingly, you failed to notice that until now.
    Me: 	Hey, I've been looking for you. (Damn, her body looks pretty firm.)
    Violet:	Oh, ummm... "Looking for me"? (That's kinda sweet. Does he like--) 
    Me: 	I need to give you these guidelines. You should read them.
    Violet:	Oh, right, of course. (Yeah, why would he...)
    Me: 	I haven't introduced myself properly...
    Violet:	It's Dennis, right?
    Me: 	Yeah, how did you know?
    Violet:	I-Uhhhh... You mentioned it when we got here.
    Me: 	Did I? I don't remember.
    Violet:	I'm sure I heard you say it.
    Me: 	Oh, okay then. And you're Violet?
    Violet:	That's me.
    Me: 	Well, nice to meet you, Violet.
    Me: 	What are you doing here, anyway?
    Violet:	Umm, I needed some space, and I had to do some maintenance.
    Me: 	"Maintenance"?
    Violet:	Yeah, stretching, running, stuff like that.
    Violet:	The ride was pretty long, and I don't like it when my body gets stiff.
    Me: 	Yeah, you do look like you train a lot. (She's obviously fit, but she's still curvy as fuck.)
    Violet:	Really? Oh... *Chuckle* Ummm...
    Me: 	Belle mentioned something about sports... Are you a professional?
    Narr:	Violet's playful expression is quickly replaced by a saddened look.
    Violet:	*Sigh* Yeah... I was, actually... For a while...
    Violet:	But then...
    Narr:	You spot some bitterness in her words.
    Me: 	Ah, I see... It's okay, I won't pry.
    Me: 	Also, is it too forward to ask why you're here, Violet? I mean, you seem completely normal to me.
    Me: 	(Unlike the rest...)
    Violet:	Oh, umm... *Nervous chuckle* I wouldn't be here if I was "normal".
    Violet:	Everyone has a reason, mine is... Maybe a bit different. ("A bit"?)
    Me: 	Care to share?
    Violet:	Uhhhhh, I'd rather not talk about it... (It'll definitely scare him off.)
    Me: 	Okay, I understand.
    Me: 	Well, you have The Guidelines. Read them when you have the chance.
    Violet:	I will, I promise.
    Me: 	Good, I'll leave you to it then.
    Me: 	You should go back to camp, we'll probably have a meeting soon.
    Violet:	Okay, I won't be long.
    Narr:	After the quick talk, you go back to camp.
Narr:	The girls are briefed, and The Guidelines distributed - all loose ends are tied.
Me: 	(Guess that's it for now.)
Me: 	(I should probably find Eve, see what's next on the "to-do list".)
Narr:	On your way back, you see Eve heading towards you.
Me: 	Hi.
Eve:	Hey there, spying on our patients, hmm?
Me: 	Yeah, nothing's more attractive than unstable chicks.
Me: 	You're in a good mood today.
Eve:	I'm always in a good mood, comes with age.
Narr:	Eve approaches the patients' residences and calls out...
Eve:	Laaaaadieees! If you're done unpacking, I'd like you to meet us outside.
Narr:	Turning back around to face you...
Eve:	I hope you're ready. The main event is about to begin.
Narr:	One by one, the girls slowly congregate around Eve.
Eve:	Hello again, everyone.
Eve:	I see everyone has already gathered, very good.
Eve:	We're glad you applied to Red Falls. That was probably one of the better choices you'll make in your life.
svi:	*Scoff*
Eve:	Over the course of the next two months, we'll slowly get to know each other.
Eve:	We have lots of activities planned for you, so please, relax and enjoy your stay.
Eve:	Get to know one another, staff included.
Eve:	Push through your inadequacies and become better people.
Eve:	That is all.
Eve:	Does anyone have any questions?
Narr:	Without waiting for an answer...
Eve:	No? Good.
Eve:	Alright, your first order of business for getting to know one another...
Eve:	Is to strip naked.
